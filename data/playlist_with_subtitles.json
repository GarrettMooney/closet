But equal top.\nCher, what the hell?\nThat performance,\nthe single tear in the opera.\n[00:03:01]\nAnd she\u2019s the most beautiful person\nthat\u2019s ever lived.\nAnd the kicking the can.\nIt actually made me want\nto step up my acting game\nwhen I watched Cher in this.\nThere\u2019s a groundedness to her\nthat I found just awe-inspiring.\nSo, Moonstruck.\nPunch-Drunk Love,\nspecifically for the phone call\nthat Philip Seymour Hoffman makes.\nIt blew my mind.\nHe is my favorite actor of all time.\nIt\u2019s also got Shelley Duvall\nsinging on the soundtrack,\nwho I love and feel an affinity to.\nAnd Olive Oyl in Popeye,\nthe \u201cHe Needs Me\u201d song,\ngenius use of it.\nSo,\nlove.\nAnd I\u2019ve also got this down because,\nwhen we were doing White Lotus,\na lot of us rewatched these.\nSo, I always related\nto the first one the most.\nAnd then it was quite a big moment\nwhen I realized I now relate\nto the second one more\n[00:04:00]\nand I\u2019ve grown up,\nand there\u2019ll be a day that the third one\nwill resonate with me more,\nand it just feels like it\u2019s a trilogy\nthat you grow with.\nSo I\u2019ll take The Before Trilogy\nwith me home.\nFunny Girl.\nFunny Girl!\nBabs.\nLove her.\nAnd, really weird, the other day\nI started singing \u201cPeople\u201d from Funny Girl\nand the lady I was working with was like,\n\u201cWhy are you singing that song?\u201d\nAnd I said,\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just came to me.\u201d\nAnd it was the song that her husband\u2026\nIt was the first ever song\nher husband played for her\nwhen she went back to his house\non the night that they met.\nAnd they\u2019ve been together ever since.\nAnd I randomly picked up on that energy\nand started singing \u201cPeople.\u201d\nBut I remember watching it\nwhen I was younger and just\nrelating hard to it all,\nof feeling like the funny one,\nbut who wanted to be the\npretty romantic lead,\nbut felt like I was destined\nto be the weird, funny girl.\n[00:05:00]\nBut I love the weird, funny girls.\nNow I understand that\nthat\u2019s the way to do it.\nIt\u2019s actually the best thing to be."}

uh this is one\nof his favorite movies as well okay so\nyou I'm just going to be completely\ncliche here and I'm going to pick a\ncassavetes here is my favorite\ncassavetes film The Killing of a Chinese\nbookie you have everything that one\ncomes to love in a cassavetes movie\nIncredible extras casting but then also\nincredible casting in the actors around\nuh Ben gazara Seymour Cal of course is\nin it another um cassavetes Muse and the\nphotography you can see the focus polls\nas the as they're trying to improvise uh\nthe movement with the actors so the the\n[00:03:00]\ncameraman is Dancing with the actors in\nin a in a really jittery way uh that's\nthe way cavetti achieves immediacy uh\nand you don't feel like actors are\nacting you feel like you're present in a\nroom and an exquisite exquisite portrait\nof a smalltime loser who gets in uh way\nover his head all right I'm going to go\nthere and I'm going to do um I'm I'm\ngoing to do not one but two Cohen\nBrothers movies and yes that is uh\nprodomo very you know selfish of me\nbecause without Joel and Ethan I\nprobably wouldn't have much of an acting\ncareer but what can I say how can you\nnot do the Cohen Brothers when you're in\nthis closet uh they're two of the most\nimportant filmmakers not only alive but\nwho've ever lived in my opinion so uh\namong those that are available here uh\n[00:04:01]\nthe first one I want to talk about is\ninside Le and Davis and it tells the\nstory of a guy named Luen Davis a\nfictional character um inspired by Dave\nVon Ron uh who just misses the boat uh\nhe's a down on his\nluck talented singer\nsongwriter who makes bad choices\npersonally irresponsible Cho choices\npersonally and is always like many Cohen\nBrothers characters are just a step\nbehind the enemal forces in life and\nhe's trying to catch up and just impose\nsome measure of control over life's\nhalfhazard uh Topsy Turvy uh unfair\nforces that's the quintessential to me\nuh Cohen brother 's character even when\n[00:05:01]\na character is talented or\noptimistic uh or is just sure of success\nthey're they're always going to get\nsmacked\ndown so another Co Brothers film uh\nthat's here um absolutely one of my\nfavorites is Miller's\nCrossing this is a movie I'm just going\nto tell you you need to watch it not\ntwice but you need to watch it three\ntimes uh at the very least because the\nthe story is so intentionally almost\nwillfully uh convoluted and Gabriel burn\nis incredible uh um Mara Gay Harden is\nuh phenomenal playing the character of\nVerna uh Albert finny extraordinary\nperformance but it's tuturo John tuturo\nplays a character named named Bernie\n[00:06:00]\nburn Bal and what John does uh in in\nthis performance in terms of what I like\nto call as an actor taking a dive when\nan actor takes a dive they just allow\nthemselves to be ugly to be humiliated\nto be unappealing in every way without\nany vanity to it because of course you\ncan be\nunappealing and it can be vain at the\nsame time because you're saying to the\nworld look at how unappealing I can be\naren't I a wonderful actor that's not\nwhat's going on in Jon's performance he\njust Embraces the notion of being the\naesthetic of being unappealing and it's\na gorgeous performance it's one of my\nfavorite character actor performances in\nall of Cinema and it's certainly my\nfavorite performance by John tuturo who\nhas given performance after performance\nworthy of nothing but praise I've been\n[00:07:02]\npresented with the option of just\npicking something randomly off the shelf\nuh probably I'm not going to know what\nthe movie is and here we\ngo okay well already I want to see this\nit's\nU's Tokyo story but look at this\ncover there you go bye for"}

lover I\nlove movies I am actually freaking out\nbecause I used to like study like film\nby going to like the Barnes &amp; Noble like\nin my like there's a Barnes Noble in\nGreensboro North Carolina there was a\nBarnes &amp; Noble in faville North Carolina\nand there was a Barnes Noble in Rowan\nOak Virginia and so I would like go\nbetween the three of them and sort of\nlike decide to like make a full\nunderstanding of film history through\nthe movies I got from carteran\ncollection okay uh I just saw the one I\nwanted\nfirst oh\nokay this is important so I'm getting\nthe Melvin Van pee's essential films\nmainly because sweet sweetback's badass\nsong is in it but also Watermelon Man is\nin it which is a very important movie to\nme but sweet sweet back's badass song\nwas a movie that I used to use to woo\n[00:01:00]\nBoys in college like I'd be like hey\nlike have you ever seen like a movie\ncalled sweet sweet back's badass song\nand they were like what no like but they\nlike the title Everyone likes that title\nthe title is so sexy and like alluring\nand like inviting I got laid a lot in\ncollege because of sweet sweet be's\nbadass song so thank you m pees he also\nokay people don't know this but he's\nalso a playright he wrote like one of\nthe best musicals to ever be on Broadway\npremiered in 1972 it's called ain't\nsupposed to die natural death and it was\nlike a soldout Smash Hit he like\ncasually just wrote all the music like\nhas the first lesbian love song in a\nmusical ever first time rap is ever in a\nmusical ever this guy was like a [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]\npolyglot like of Storytelling okay um I\nsee another important one okay so um I\njust made a documentary about um my play\na documentary about to play but it was a\nprocess Doc and I kept telling everyone\nlike I want to make a movie that was\n[00:02:00]\nlike a' 70s documentary and everyone was\nlike what kind of documentaries are you\ntalking about and I was like talking\nabout things like this like company the\noriginal cast album by Penny Baker one\nof the best documentaries ever made it's\nlike completely ver you see some of the\nlike richest most dynamic performers of\na generation having Full Tilt mental\nbreakdowns like actual mental breakdowns\nabout the fact that they cannot\narticulate the beautiful thing they did\non stage every night in a cast recording\nand I'm so happy cuz I've never owned it\num I I was only streaming it on\nCriterion Channel now I can stream it\nfrom my\nPS5 oh well this one huge huge moment\nfor me so um I haven't found any of the\nLars font Trier but Lars rant Trier and\nDogma 95 were very very important to me\num because I didn't know that someone\ncould make rules around how to make a\nmovie I thought you just like made one\num I didn't know that they that you\ncould create a system around the making\n[00:03:00]\nand dog 1995 is like very important\nsystem he he sort of created and the\nfirst film that was the dog 195 film\napproved film was the celebration also\nthey have the full dog 95 thing in here\nthis\nis like I could actually kind of cry\nlike this is actually crazy so thank you\nokay this is important I'm getting the\nbox set but I just had to shout this\nmovie out anyway um Tama I realized this\nyear um with the amount of people who\ntold me how much they love saltburn that\nno one had seen in my friend group had\nseen tarama watch tarama just do\nyourself a favor I'm not putting it in\nmy bag because I'm getting a box set but\nbecause pasolini is important again um\nthere's a lot of required reading to be\ngay in my opinion and a lot of that\nreading is in movies and a lot of those\nmovies are weird and European and um\npasolini watch it all like I just saw up\nhere another important movie for me\npartially because I share a birthday\nwith uh the marqu Assad marqu Assad who\n[00:04:02]\nwrote the book that salow is based on\nthis movie was so so important to me and\nalso in a time when I probably should\nhave known better um while I was in grad\nschool and I was showing my uh cast of\nfirst year students like what things\ninspired me to write this play where\npeople were [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on stage and\nyelling about how much they hated being\nat school and treating Yale School of\ndrama like a sort of um fashion prison I\ndecided to show them all um this movie\nand I realized can't really do that in\n2019 it's a harder thing to do you know\nwhat I mean but I'm telling you right\nnow I'm hoping you're consenting um if\nyou watch this movie you will it'll\nchange your life you'll see a lot of bad\nstuff there's a lot of yuck in it but\nyou'll get to a yum at the very end okay\nso I was actually going to name check\nher anyway because Lena Dunham who is\none of the most you know one of the\n[00:05:01]\npeople who's who changed my life the\nmost with the work that she did both in\ngirls and in Tiny Furniture um because\nshe's one of those people that like gave\nme permission much like you know Melvin\nVan Peebles to just like tell my story\nhow I wanted to tell it anyway tiny fish\nis really good but there's another\nfilmmaker here a female filmmaker that I\nknow about because she it she said it\ninspired her work and another filmmaker\nfriend of mine jix Bravo had a poster of\nit in the show that she was working on\nand it was all cyclical it's like a\nweird friend love affair so actually I'm\ngoing to ask for some help where could I\nfind Claudia V or Claudia Wheels\ngirlfriends so this is girlfriends and\nit was an iconic movie from like it was\nlike so well received when it came out\nand she was just forgotten and I feel so\nlucky that two filmmakers that I love\nwho happen to be women told me I needed\nto watch this movie so I'm going to now\nand now own it okay oh back wall oh oh\nmy God yay hey okay yay All That Jazz\n[00:06:02]\nokay this is the best movie no okay they\nthere's all these lists like best movie\nmusical blah blah blah destroy them all\nthat jazz best movie musical no one\nknows how to shoot dance anymore and\nthat's listen there have been some big\nmusicals that have come out recently by\nsome big directors people we know people\nwe love they don't know how to shoot\ndance as well as this man did none of\nthem do FY knows what movement looks\nlike on camera because he is movement\nincarnate this film is so honest and\nbeautiful and Rich it is everything a\nfilm should be I love it watch it\nfastfender is so important and one of\nthe things I love about ali Fury soul is\nthat it feels like something that like\npeople will be afraid to write now about\nlike the very present like like racism\nand um uh that lives inside of our\nbodies because of like society and like\nour families Etc but how people have to\n[00:07:00]\nnavigate that through intimacies it also\nis like just like sexy and funny and\nweird and\nunprecipitated masterpieces like this\none sometimes they won't be but you'll\nbe making um and that's just one way to\ndo it and it's good to remind yourself\nthat there's a lot of ways to do to\ncrack an egg okay guys I think I I think\nI do just have to I have to end it I'm\ngoing get y I'm going to get y um\nbecause we love y um oh oh and this is\nanother one I was going to get this one\nanyway so I'm glad I saw it Metropolitan\num I used to tell people that I wanted\nto be like the black gay with Stillman\nhe's such a Dandy and a fop and like\nwrites about people that like you don't\nsee written about very often and like\nthis type of way so yeah um thank you\n[00:08:03]\nguys this has been really fun I'm I\ncould stay I could live in here I don't\nwant to leave"}

get\nembarrassed about it you you always want\nto say that you saw all these movies\nlike at least a decade ago right but I\njust saw this a few years ago all that\njazzz I had that feeling of like why did\nno one tell me about this you know when\nit's like a movie was like made for you\nand it feels like it's been in your\nbones your whole life and you're just\nlike I can't believe I've just been\nwandering the Earth and none of my\nfriends are good enough friends to have\ntold me to watch this movie I'm sure\nthey\ndid clude is one of the coolest\nmovies I remember watching this I think\nI had my laptop and like a little\nexternal disc drive on the set of one of\nthe Twilight movies cuz I spent a lot of\ntime in my trailer on those movies cuz I\n[00:01:01]\nwas barely in them you know toward the\nend like Donald Sutherland is like\nrushing in to save Jane Fonda and I'd\nget called to set and I would be like\nirrationally unhinged like uh on edge\nand just like wanting to get back to my\ntrailer yeah wanting to get back to your\ntrailer makes you sound like a dick but\nyou know when you're halfway through\nClute um I think that's a good\nexcuse\nstalker beautiful stunning\nhypnotizing and really kind of deals\nwith the nasty business of looking at\noneself and how devastating that can be\nand\nthematically that's my\npassion of J AR I will say I think\nthat sometimes I fall victim to that\nthing where um\ncertain scores for silent films uh take\nme out of it and I will say like one of\nthe cooler\n[00:02:00]\ncinematic going experiences I've had is\nuh they were showing a print of this at\nthe silent movie theater on Fairfax and\nthere were these two guys who did like a\na modern experimental score to this and\nI was weeping\nuncontrollably almost the entire time I\nalso just saw Sant um it's a French\ncourtroom drama take on the media myth\nbut also can I say between this and\nanatomy of a fall what's going on in the\nFrench court system this is not a joke\nthis is not like a jokey thing I'm doing\nI would really love for like someone who\nknows the French legal system to like I\ndon't know hit me up on Twitter I don't\nknow it seems a lot more like a like a\nfamily therapy session than a than a\nlegal structure in both films but um\nyeah if there are French lawyers who\nspeak excellent English because my\nFrench is um that would be so\namazing okay I will say I did I I feel\n[00:03:00]\nincredibly special and I did not just\npull this off of the Shelf at random\nthis is um like a kind of a\ncomprehensive Bergman collection I think\nwhen I was like maybe 18 uh somebody\ngifted me the fanny and Alexander uh box\nset and it was one of those experiences\nwhere sometimes you watch a movie and\nyou immediately love it like all that\njazz where you go this is like someone's\nlooking inside my brain and that was not\nthat experience\nbut it was something challenging like it\nwas something that touched a part of me\nthat was untouched or that was too\nsensitive to touch I remember even\nwatching interviews with him where he\nwould talk about late in his life talk\nabout how he still was terrified of\ndeath and had not resolved that and\nparticularly as someone who was like a\nteenager at the time that was very\nunsettling to hear cuz you want to hear\nthat people as they get older become\n[00:04:00]\nokay and accepting of death and it's\nlike even in his interviews and\ncertainly in his art it's like he's\nincapable of telling lies to keep\nhimself comfortable and certainly to\nkeep you comfortable um and it sent me\ndown this journey and now he is one of\nif not my favorite directors I think\nwinterl is probably my favorite Bergman\nfilm if I had to choose I also\nparticularly adore cries and Whispers um\nthe production design the performance of\nwonderful but there's this scene where\nthese two sisters have this kind of come\nto Jesus and then at the end of the trip\nas they're departing one of the sisters\nis like I'm so glad that we had that\nmoment and we've kind of had this\nbreakthrough and the other sister goes I\nmean I'm translating from Swedish so\nit's not this um she's like oh God I\nknow that was so silly that was\nridiculous anyway it was so good to see\nyou and it's just it makes you want to\nnever speak to another human being and\n[00:05:01]\nthen it also makes you realize that\nthat's the only thing worth doing like\nto curl up in a ball out of that fear of\nbeing distanced and rejected is not a\nway to live I just I love this man I\nlove this man and I love you guys

The film looked vintage,\nbut I couldn\u2019t quite make out\nwhat it was, and\u2026\nyou know, after a week\nof seeing him perform,\nI asked, I was like, \u201cYo, what is it?\u201d\nAnd he says it\u2019s one of his all-time\nfavorite films called Black Orpheus.\nAnd he had about\u2026\nten copies of Black Orpheus,\nwhich he would constantly have on loop.\nAnd eventually I got this.\nAnd of course\nI now know why he loves this.\nThis won the Palme d\u2019Or in\u2026\n1959, I believe.\nAnd it\u2019s probably one of\nthe most beautifully shot films.\nBlack Orpheus.\nThe Monterey Pop Festival\nis probably one of\nthe most brilliant, brilliant\n[00:02:04]\ncaptures of concert footage.\nThe most legendary story, of course,\nis the Jimi Hendrix Experience\nperformance where\nHendrix famously\ndoes \u201cWild Thing\u201d and then he\nputs his guitar on the floor\nand he destroys it and he sets it on fire.\nAlso another performance\nthat really doesn\u2019t get talked about\nis Otis Redding\u2019s performance.\nAnd, you know, this is the moment where\nOtis really rises to the occasion,\nyou know, from Southern soul singer,\nwith a niche audience\nof Black soul lovers,\nand this is where, really,\nhe was able to connect to\nthe love generation,\nthose that lived out in the Bay Area\nthat was really open to him.\nProbably more than Woodstock,\nthis really captures what\u2026\n[00:03:02]\nthe possibilities of what could have been.\nGimme Shelter.\nWhich is kind of the opposite\nof The Monterey Pop Festival.\nPart reality show, part\u2026\nDogme 95 almost.\nYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\nYou just gotta go with the moment.\nAnd be present, be a fly on the wall.\nAnd this is probably the greatest example.\nA concert\u2019s thrown and\u2026\na murder occurs\nduring the Rolling Stones\u2019 performance and\nit\u2019s so chilling to watch the Stones\nwatch the footage of the murder.\nThis film represents\nthe ebb and flow of America.\nYou have hope.\nAnd then\u2026\nyou get nope.\nOkay, so another\nmajor moment for me.\nDo the Right Thing.\nWhen Spike Lee\ngot the Criterion treatment,\n[00:04:00]\noh my God. And all the extras in it.\nSpike\u2019s preserved the storyboards,\nthe audition tapes,\nthe day that everyone first meets,\nthem building the sets,\nthe pizzeria, them building it by hand.\nSo you get to see, soup to nuts.\nIt\u2019s as if Spike knew\nthat some ten years later,\nsome twenty years later,\nthat they would contextualize this\nand he kept everything.\nAnd so this is kind of\u2026\nYes, of course, Do the Right Thing\nis the fabric of all filmmaking,\nbut this specific Criterion Collection\nfor me\nis what probably turned me\ninto a pack rat.\nThat\u2019s when I realized:\nsave every liner note,\nsave every sneaker from a video shoot,\nsave posters from backstage\nbecause one day,\nyou might not expect it, but what you do\nmight be seen as important, so\u2026\n[00:05:02]\nif you\u2019re gonna get\nDo the Right Thing and watch it,\nI would watch\nthe Criterion version of this,\nespecially if you want to learn about\nindie filmmaking.\nNow, speaking of Spike Lee,\nimagine my surprise\nwhen a film that I\u2019m in,\nBamboozled,\nmade Criterion status.\nWords will never describe\nthe entire experience of us shooting this.\nSo Spike Lee comes to\nElectric Lady Studios,\nand the first thing he pulls out\nis just a bunch of these\nminstrel entertainment era dolls.\nAnd he explained to me\nthe premise of Bamboozled.\nNow, mind you, it\u2019s 1999,\nand, you know,\nthis is one of the cases in which\na satire\n[00:06:00]\nis so over the top, exaggerated.\nWe looked at each other like,\n\u201cIs he crazy? This\u2019ll never fly.\nHe thinks there\u2019s a future\nin which, like, non-actors\nare going to be on television\nand they\u2019ll do whatever it takes\nto be famous,\nno matter what, like, to their dignity?\nHe thinks that\u2019s gonna happen one day?\u201d\nAnd he purposely put our trailer\nthree blocks away from the set.\nSo, in full blackface make-up\nand a jail suit,\nthe Roots have to walk three blocks.\nAnd, without context,\neveryone\u2019s looking at us like\u2026\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s not them.\u201d\nLike, literally,\nit was so over the top that\nno one knew it was the Roots.\nAnd now that it\u2019s 25 years later,\neverything,\neverything in this movie has happened.\n[00:07:02]\nSo,\nit\u2019s one of those things where\nSpike was so ahead of time that\ntime eventually caught up to him.\nBut, yeah, Bamboozled, Spike Lee."}

heels but do I want to\ntake it with me yeah I suppose I do\nbecause it it means a lot to me this\nmovie Night of the\nhunter it's very I bet you know loads of\nyou know it it's this very famous movie\nand Martin mcdono and I first met him\nwas like night of the hunter This Night\nof the hunter that you have to watch\nNight of the Hunter and um I remember\nwatching it and having a big effect on\nme and I remember didn't he have tattoos\nand his and his hands that really stuck\nout to me so I'm going to take this one\nand maybe I'll give it to Martin for a\npresent or maybe I'll keep it there's\nsome oh fish tank and Dre Arnold that's\na great one and what's his name Michael\nfast Bender's characters are real\nbollocks in it and K came Lo is another\n[00:01:00]\none I love at George Washington that was\nBrill and that was um your man's first\nfilm that guy David Gardon green it\ncaptures Youth and childhood and and and\nit makes you remember like when you were\na kid and what that was like and I think\nthat's kind of hard like first of all\nacting with children and directing\nchildren is really hard you have to be\nreally delicate cuz it's like they're\nkids but it's also um you know to kind\nof put yourself in what you're mind was\nlike as a kid um that was a really I\nremember that movie being bril let's see\nwhat the tin drum you know I will say\nthis the tnd Drome I remember seeing\nthis there's a good few movies that I've\nseen when I was in my early 20s and I'm\nnot going to lie like I was kind of\nstoned so I vaguely remember them and\nI've seen them so there's a lot of\nmovies I should\nrewatch actually I'll take the tnd drum\nbecause I saw it when I was very young\n[00:02:00]\nand maybe it'll all come flooding back\nto me sometimes as well do you ever go\nout with somebody like I go out with\nsomeone and they're like what B do you\nlike and you know they're trying to\ncheck like how cool you are or whatever\nso sometimes I feel that way about\nmovies it's like hang on a minute like\nI'm entitled to my own taste even if\nit's not like super high brow so\nhopefully I'm not being judged oh\nsecrets and lies I won't take this\nbecause I've seen it loads but when I\nwas young and I wanted to be an actress\nbrand of blon and this was so inspiring\nshe was nominated for an Oscar I believe\nat the time and Mike Lee his method of\num his style of actually I'll take it\nactually because I want to work with\nMikey and I don't want to screw myself\nout of a job so um I love Mikey and I\nloved secrets and\nlies um oh there's one up there that I'm\nnot going to take all right because I\ncan see it a it's high up and B I have\nit already but maab and Mrs Miller will\nI get it do you want me to get it I'll\nget it and I'll show what but the reason\n[00:03:01]\nI'm not taking it because I have\nit is because an ex-boyfriend gave it to\nme and I started watching it and I was\nlike do you know what turn it off so\nthere you go maab and Mrs Miller I'm\nsure it's great\nbut he did a bit of a number on me so oh\nValley of the Dolls Valley of the Dolls\nis BR that's one youd kind of watch all\nthe time it's so\nentertaining I feel bad now maave and\nMrs Miller is probably ra may I maybe in\ntime you know time heals all wounds as\nthey say um my favorite and I see it and\nit's my favorite movie and I've\nmentioned it before so I hope I'm not\nlike repeating\nmyself dog fight oh my god dog\nfight there's so many reasons why I\nreally like this movie I watched it when\nI was very you know a teenager and I\nreally wanted to be an actress so Lily\n[00:04:00]\nTaylor in this movie completely affected\nhow I thought about acting and how I\nthought about like what kind of actress\nI wanted to be because the movie is\nbasically about these bunch of young\nLads are heading off to fighting Vietnam\nthe next day but the night before they\ngo they have this game called Dog fight\nwhere the challenge is to bring the\nugliest girl to a party and the guy who\nbrings the ugliest girl wins and River\nPhoenix oh he's so brilliant in it and\nhe looks so young and innocent be going\noff to V Vietnam and he's trying to find\nsomeone and it's late at night and he\ncan't find someone and then he goes into\na cafe and he\nfinds beautiful Lily\nTaylor um but in the story she's not\nbeautiful you know she doesn't look\nperfect or whatever people think is\nbeautiful and but anyways he takes her\nout and there is a scene she finds out\nit's a dog F I'm not giving the whole\nstory away I'm just giving you the first\nbit of it but there's a scene where\nshe's playing the piano and she's\nsinging a song and he's watching her and\n[00:05:00]\nthere's no dialogue I'm going to start\ncrying just thinking about it because\nhe's smoking this cigarette and he's\nwatching her and he's he was such a pure\nbeautiful actor that like he starts to\nrealize that oh hang on she's really\nsweet and she's really deep and\nbeautiful and actually I don't want to\nhurt her and it all happens just in his\nface while he's smoking watching her and\nit is so beautiful because it affected\nme an actress but also about love it\nmade me think that like you know love is\nlike so\npersonal and how someone affects your\nsoul and LS this movie is amazing and\nlike it was directed by a woman too so\nit's all you know women directors this\nwomen directors that this movie was\ndirected by a woman a long long time ago\nand it I don't think it got the\nrecognition it deserves all right let's\nsee the last\none oh this is tricky it could I be all\n[00:06:01]\nabout my mother amazing but then it's\nbetween all about my mother or the\nprince of tid which is super romantic\nand I worked with Nick Noti and he was\nlike you know one of my favorite people\nto work with he really influenced me and\nand and he was just wild and and amazing\nto be around and to work with\nso Jesus Lads it's a tough call here we\ngot Pedro or we got Nick and so I have\nto take both them and I love them both\nso okay we're done there's so many\nokay thanks a million"}

Well, that\u2019s Sidney Lumet,\nsomeone who\u2019s workmanlike, who\ndoesn\u2019t mystify or mythologize\nhis process.\nHe\u2019s written a very good book\nabout it, on directing, and\nhe talks about it in a way that\nfeels like he\u2019s talking about\nhow to build a bridge or something,\nalmost like he\u2019s an engineer.\nIt\u2019s really refreshing.\n[00:01:01]\nIt\u2019s very honest and direct and\nunambiguous and\nvery accessible.\nWhat else? What\u2019s that?\nThe Spy Who Came in from the Cold.\nOkay, so The Spy\nWho Came in from the Cold.\nThere\u2019s a lack of color to this film,\nwhich is\u2026\nWell, it\u2019s black-and-white, but\u2026\nI mean in the way it\u2019s rendered, it\u2019s\u2026\nit leans into that monochromatic world\nthat we imagined the Cold War to be in.\nThere\u2019s a speech in this film\nthat Richard Burton gives,\nwhich is, I think, the best speech\nhe gave as an actor,\nabout what spies are.\nIt\u2019s the counterargument to James Bond.\nIt\u2019s a John le Carr\u00e9\u2026\nBased on the John le Carr\u00e9 book,\nof course, and\nreally\u2026\nreally it\u2019s worth watching\njust for that speech.\nAnd it has a bleakness to it\nI really like.\nMatter of Life and Death. Okay, so\u2026\nPowell and Pressburger,\nthey managed to embrace\nthe surreal and the avant-garde\n[00:02:02]\nand still make something\naccessible and popular.\nAnd that is such a hard thing to pull off.\nAnd they do it so well.\nBut A Matter of Life and Death\nis wonderful. David Niven.\nFunny, witty.\nDeals with mortality and love\nin a\u2026\nin a fun way.\nI love them for that. And that\u2019s\u2026\nThis film in particular is\na great one\nthat deserves repeated viewing.\nOkay, The Servant.\nCracking movie.\nAll about the British class system.\nFull of tension and\nmicroscopic attention to detail.\nIt\u2019s about power play.\nThe shift of power in a relationship.\nReally stands the test of time.\nVery interesting that\nJoseph Losey, this American\u2026\nIt takes an American,\nan outsider, if you like,\nto sort of see the British class system\nobjectively, because he\u2019s not part of it.\nSo he can see it\nas an outsider, as a witness.\nYeah, I love this film.\nIt\u2019s fantastic.\nKlute, Alan J. Pakula.\n[00:03:00]\nThis is\nvery morally ambiguous.\nJane Fonda gives, I think,\nthe performance of her career.\nAnd it\u2019s disturbing and unsettling,\nand the way it\u2019s framed,\nit makes you a voyeur.\nSometimes the screen will be\u2026\nthere\u2019ll be a big wide screen\nand half of the screen will be black\nand the other half will be black\nand it\u2019s just a narrow gap in a doorway\nthat you\u2019re looking through.\nPlays the whole scene like that.\nIt takes real confidence.\nAnd it\u2019s not\njust there to be different\nor experimental.\nIt actually serves the narrative.\nYou feel like you\u2019re pulled into it.\nYou feel you\u2019re eavesdropping.\nSo you lean into the screen\nand listen to it more.\nFantastic film.\nHave to\u2026\nAnd let\u2019s see what else we got.\nHis Girl Friday.\nOkay.\nOften these films,\nit\u2019s best to always see them\non a big screen\nbecause they don\u2019t go in for close-ups.\nThey just rehearse it, almost like\nit\u2019s a play. And they stay on the wide.\nAnd they just have these characters who\u2026\nyour eye goes to them,\nthe way it would in the theater.\n[00:04:01]\nSomeone gives a performance,\nyou just check them out\nand then you look over here.\nYou sort of do the edit yourself.\nBut they\u2019re so well rehearsed that\nall the cues are really fast.\nIt\u2019s like they\u2019ve rehearsed it\nto within an inch of its life, so\nit\u2019s very tight, very disciplined.\nThis is Hollywood at its best\nbecause it\u2019s smart, savvy,\nthere\u2019s an emotional dynamic to it. It\u2019s\u2026\nYeah, they don\u2019t make them like this\nanymore. They try, but they don\u2019t.\nThat\u2019s all.\nWhat an amazing thing film is\nthat you can just disappear\ninto another world for two hours\nand let it envelop you\nand forget about your life.\nWhich sometimes is a nice thing to do."}

one of the first films\nI think I ever saw was this camera shaft\nby Joseph pabs\noh and here's another one\num come and see one of our favorites we\nhad the um pleasure of talking with the\ncinematographer for the podcast and it\nwas amazing\nhow they made the movie\nyeah it's a very strange cover\nit's an interesting film because some\npoints the main character this kid is\nlooking straight at the lens and other\ntimes it feels like a documentary\num filming the the horrors of the yeah\nNazi regime Tokyo Olympiad right which\nwas directed by con ichigawa and on the\nfamous Japanese cinematographer Keizer\nmiyagawa he was overseeing the\nphotography of it\n[00:01:02]\ndid two of my favorite movies fires on\nthe plane\nand he did another film called Burmese\nharp both set in the World War II and\nit's so interesting that he made Konichi\nGoa made those two films and then he\nmade Tokyo Olympiad which is one of the\nbest documentaries about sport ever made\nI think as far as on the plane yeah and\nBurmese heart\nlook at that Roger well done\n[Laughter]\nI'm sorry but I've got to pick this one\nwhat's that sit in there\num we saw it recently because we\nremastered it here and it's just an\nincredible\nincredible document of the times I think\nyeah and um well it felt very real\nbecause I remember shooting concerts\nwith these punks in Hammersmith and\nhaving to wear a plastic Mac because\nthey're all spitting at the stage and I\n[00:02:01]\nwas on the stage doing handheld of Gary\nand the sex pistols and we were all\ngetting covered in well it was not very\nnice let's change this look at this look\nCircle Rouge oh yes now this to me is\nthe probably one of the apart from\ntarkovsky probably my\nall-time great director jean-piel\nMelville but there's an early film he\ndid\nsilence still in there also shot by\nAndre deccai one of their first ones the\nfirst collaboration afterwards they did\nthe doulas and all sorts of things\num but this one is absolutely\nmagnificent it all takes place in a\nsmall cottage during the war where this\nGerman Soldier left tonight is is\nbilleted to stay with this old man and\nhis granddaughter\nand these two that The Old Man and the\n[00:03:00]\ngranddaughter refused to talk to the\nGerman the Nazi until right at the end\nbut you have to watch it if I'm what\nhappens because very little happens it's\nall about this relationship\nit's very very moving it's one of the\nbest war films ever made that all takes\nplace in the front room yeah little\ncottage in France yeah it is a great\nfilm\nseventh seal I'm sorry but I love this\nfilm every Halloween\nI would watch this\nthat was great so before I really even\nunderstood it not that I understand it\nnow but I I would watch it and um I have\nnot seen the restoration so I really\nwant to\nyes brilliantly there's so many great\nmovies here laventura\nyou know there's something about this\nfilm\nthat it's not literal\nyeah there's a story but you know it's a\nstory about a relationship and it's a\n[00:04:00]\nstory about\na man who's trying to find himself\nthere's so much is so much is built up\nthrough the images and the pacing and\nthe\nit's real movies you know if I could if\nI could describe what I love about this\nmovie then I'd write a book but you\ncan't describe it because it's a movie a\nmovie can do something that no other\nmedium can do\nand when it works it really works and\nwhen it really works it's called\nlaventura\nwe have missed out the all-time great\nfilm director which is\nwhat do you mean\nmirror there's mirror and there should\nbe Solaris Solaris Solaris which is\ngreat I don't I think this Solaris it's\nreally interesting Solaris was made\njust a little bit later than Kubrick's\nand tarkovsky said he could never do\n[00:05:02]\n2001.\nbut he wanted to do a film that was\nreally\nsomething that was more with the\nemotionally engaged with you he felt he\nfelt Kubrick's film was rather cold and\na piece of wonderful technology but had\nlittle to engage you with emotionally\nand personally I think he's absolutely\nright I think Solaris is his Solaris is\nthe best science fiction film probably\never made and the most profound here we\nare we've found something tucked away in\nthe far Corner down below where you\ncould hardly see it which is one of to\nme not only great film but probably\nthe best black and white cinematography\nI've ever seen by Conrad Hall and also\nit's just amazing the transitions\nbetween the scenes the thought that was\nput behind it yeah some of the best\n[00:06:00]\ntransitions but also I mean the\ncinematography is wonderful because he\nshoots the desert landscape like you've\nnever seen it before but then he

It\u2019s awesome.\nFreaks is obviously, like, a major classic\nthat a lot of people know.\nBut The Mystic and The Unknown\nare movies that people know a lot less.\nI actually saw The Unknown, like,\non TV when I was a teenager.\nAnd it\u2019s this, like,\namazing, transformative\nperformance by Lon Chaney.\nOf course, it\u2019s transformative,\nit\u2019s Lon Chaney.\nAnyway, this is...\nAnd it\u2019s, like, the special features\nare also, like, insane, so...\ndefinitely, definitely check this out\nif you\u2019re a Tod Browning fan,\nif you\u2019re a Universal horror fan,\n[00:04:02]\nif you\u2019re a silent movie horror fan.\nIt\u2019s fucking cool.\nThe Innocents is by Jack Clayton.\nThis is one of my favorite films.\nI watch it, like, twice a year, probably.\nI love Freddie Francis,\nthe cinematographer,\nlike in, you know,\nhis work with David Lynch,\nparticularly The Elephant Man.\nBut his work with Jack Clayton\nis, I think, his best work.\nI feel like they really\npushed each other\nto have the most sophisticated\nand elegant staging\nthat doesn\u2019t draw\nattention to itself,\nbut, like, just pulls you\ninto the story.\nThe studio wanted them\nto shoot it in Scope,\nthey wanted to shoot it, like,\nin 1:33 or 1:37,\nand you know what?\nIt ended up being one of the\nbest-looking movies in Scope ever.\nAnd then they made a little vignette\nto do these sort of nighttime, hallway,\nhorror-movie-set-piece scenes\nin a way that felt\nmore like an Academy ratio.\nSo,\nawesome movie\nif you haven\u2019t seen it, like...\n[00:05:00]\nwell, I mean, the screenplay,\nyou just...\nyour imagination is on fire with\nwith, like, the disturbing shit\nthat you don\u2019t see.\nIt\u2019s awesome.\nThank you.\nGoodbye."}

something\nthat I love very much which is the movie\nCarnival of Souls uh I love this movie\nit's the first movie I ever remember\nseeing when I was 4 years old I was left\nuh On My Own by the babysitter my entire\nfamily my parents and brother and sister\nabandoned me I was with a babysitter who\nthought it was a good idea for us to\nwatch this on the local New York\naffiliate WPIX Chiller theater and um I\nwent through an entire bag of Tootsie\nPops while I watched this at four years\nold which probably only jacked me up all\nthe more and made it even more exciting\nbut it scared the crap out of me and I\n[00:01:02]\nthink I didn't sleep for maybe a year\nit's probably only a few days but it\nfelt like a year and my parents never\nhired that babysitter again but it was\nan amazing experience and it's it's an\namazing movie I see another wonderful\nmovie here that I love very much the\nlife and death of Colonel blimp it has a\nwonderful actor in it that I love very\nmuch named Anton Walbrook who I don't\nthink did a whole lot of movies but he's\ngreat in this movie and this has an\nincredible sequence in the middle of it\nthat I love very much uh where uh this\nBritish soldier is challenged to a duel\nby a German soldier and this is great\nsequence that builds up to this\nwonderful duel it's a very funny movie\nit's a very moving movie it's a big\nexpansive sort of uh uh Epic movie about\nkind of British history from sort of the\nbeginning of the 19th century for the\nsecond world war but I love that\ndueling rashan it's the only movie that\nmakes makes me cry when I see it it's\n[00:02:02]\nyou know hard to make me cry it's like\nblood from a stone with me but this\nmovie for some reason at the end the\nvery sort of poetic ending comes out of\nnowhere and it's a really beautiful\nmovie and at the end of it always gets\nme I guess I this is this is always a\nthing that I love Solaris I'm a great\nadmir of the uh guy who wrote the book\nit's based on Stannis La Lama polish\nscience fiction writer and I'd been\nwanting to see this movie because I'd\nheard it existed in the early '90s I\nfound a copy of it in a in a video store\nout in Seattle and watched it and um it\nbored the hell out of me I didn't know\nwhat the hell I was watching and it blew\nmy mind there's like a 10-minute\nsequence of just driving in this movie\nthrough the window and over the years\nthough I Revisited it and came to love\nit very much love all of his movies but\nI like this one in particular and this\n[00:03:01]\nfantastic fantastic sort of production\ndesign of kind of a crappy spaceship\nthat they all live on I often wonder if\nI how I feel about the very final shot\nof this movie which I won't give away\nbut I sometimes feel like maybe it uh\nmaybe it wasn't necessary the final shot\nof that body if Andre tarkovski were\naround I would question him ah it's way\nup there watch this there's a little\naction sequence in the closet for\nI love these movies I'm a big fan of\nthese valut and horror movies cat people\num there was a sequel to it he was a\nproducer the sky Val Luton made this\nseries of\nmovies um I don't know six of them seven\nof them something like that Boris carof\nwas in some of them but I love these\nmovies cuz they're very lowbudget and\nthey're this amazing example of doing\nall this extraordinary stuff with\nabsolutely nothing and creating these\nincredibly scary effects in them uh they\n[00:04:02]\nall have these gripping great almost\nkind of iconic moments all these movies\nthat he produced of sort of classic\nhorror moments and uh they're strange\ntoo they're all sort of on these sets it\nall feels very sort of unreal and\ndreamlike these movies this one in\nparticular it's really a it's really a\ngreat great movie where suck go ah\nyeah this is also one of my favorite\nmovies I'm a big fan of Franken heimer's\nmovies the manuri and candidate and uh\nseven days in May and the train and this\nmovie I remember seeing the first time I\never saw it I might have been chemically\naltered when I saw this movie so I can't\nreally speak to whether I saw it you\nknow really as one should be seeing it\nbut it made the hugest impression on me\nbut one of the things I really love\nabout this movie is it's one of the\ngreatest examples of what a terrific\n[00:05:00]\nactor can do in a small tiny supporting\npart there's an actor named Murray\nHamilton in it who played the uh mayor\nin Jaws and he appears in the end of\nthis movie for two minutes maybe not\neven and he barely speaks and it's one\nof my favorite performances in any movie\nhe's incredible in this movie and it's\nsuch a fine example of what a great\nactor can do in a tiny\npart this is the the movie that I think\nFor Better or Worse kind\nof really pushed me over the edge and\nmade me go I want to be an actor um\neverything about it it's such a this is\nkind of a perfect movie actually and um\nI saw it recently again I hadn't seen it\nin ages and I and one of the things that\nsurprised me about it maybe I've may\nonly seen it a few times since I first\nsaw it one of things that surprised me\nwhen I thought oh it it actually has a\nreal story to it I'd never paid\n[00:06:01]\nattention to the fact that it has this\nkind of very great simple kind of Noir\nstory to it i' never paid that much\nattention to the story because I get so\ncaught up in in all the wonderful detail\nand and the wonderful acting in it and\nit's got probably my if I if you held a\ngun to my head and said what's your\nfavorite performance in any movie I\nwould say Dennis Hopper is Frank Booth\nin this movie uh he achieved something\njust\noff the charts amazing it's been I mean\neverybody's great in it CL Kyle mclin's\ngreat in it I keep talking a lot about\nthe acting in movies and you\nknow acting is not the only thing that\nfloats a movie along but it's this is\nlike I love\nthis this is\ninteresting this woman Lissa\nshapo I've only seen this movie Wings\nBut Wings is an amazing movie it's\nbeautiful movie and this fantastic\n[00:07:02]\nactress in it plays a kind of Soviet\nhero of the of the sort of Air Force\nSoviet Air Force and her life is kind of\ndreary and she has this sort of fra\nrelationship with her daughter it's one\nof these things I don't even understand\nhow how she got this made in the Soviet\nUnion because it seems sort of critical\nin some ways about uh about but she\nthere's incredible sort of poetry in it\nthere's all this great way she uses the\nflying in it and stuff to talk about\nthis woman's interior life and it's\nreally a beautiful movie but I've never\nseen the other movie she\nmade so I guess now's my time now's my\nopportunity this is ridiculous this

I think I\u2019m on\nthis DVD because I...\nI spoke to Mike Leigh about it\nwhen it was put on\nthe Criterion Collection.\nSo, yeah, Mike Leigh.\nDefinitely going\ndans le sac, as we say.\n[00:03:02]\nTrainspotting,\nwhich has actually\ngot a Pulp song\non the soundtrack of it.\nWe were making\nthe Different Class record\nand we\u2019d recorded\npretty much all the songs\nand then we got this\nmessage saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a guy\nmaking a film and\ncould you write a song for it?\u201d\nSo, there\u2019s a scene in this film\u2013\nIt\u2019s a spoiler\nif you\u2019ve not seen it, but\nit doesn\u2019t give away\ntoo much of the plot.\nThere\u2019s a scene\nwhere Ewan McGregor\u2019s character\ngoes into a toilet and\nsome drugs have been\nflushed down it and he\ngoes down into the toilet\nand ends up\nin a kind of\nunderwater environment.\nYou know, I\u2019m realizing\nas I\u2019m talking about these films\nhow a lot of the films\nthat I like\ntend to play with\nthis thing of film convention\nand then something that\u2019s...\nis a representation\nof real life, so...\nAs luck would have it,\nwe had a song called \u201cMile End\u201d\n[00:04:03]\nthat we\u2019d recorded but\ndidn\u2019t really fit on the album.\nAnd so we said,\n\u201cCould you use that?\u201d\nThat was a bit of\nkind of serendipity.\nSo...\nthis is going\nin the bag too.\nThis film.\nI\u2019ve had...\nnot this particular DVD,\nbut I\u2019ve owned\nSal\u00f2, or Sal\u00f2, by\nPasolini,\nand then never found\nan appropriate time\nto watch it.\nI\u2019ve spoken to people\nabout what happens in it.\nMaybe now\u2019s the time.\nI\u2019m a big boy. I\u2019m grown up.\nI could handle it.\nI\u2019m ready for 120 Days of Sodom.\nTo put us on\na little bit more of a\nlighter note\nfor me to leave.\nA modern filmmaker\nwho I am\npleased to know\nand to have worked with\nis Wes Anderson.\nFantastic Mr. Fox.\nI do sing a song in that\n[00:05:00]\nwhich Wes wrote the words for\nand I wrote the music for it.\nI am kind of represented\nby an animated...\ncreature in that film.\nAnd The Grand Budapest Hotel.\nYou know, I think Wes\nis one of the people who\nis still trying to move cinema\nsomewhere else.\nThe way that he composes\nhis shots,\nthe way he tries to\nnot edit too much\nwithin a scene\nbut do it\nwith camera movement.\nI don\u2019t think he really gets\nthat much credit for being,\nin a way, quite experimental\nin that way. So...\nthat will calm me down\nafter 120 Days of Sodom.\nSo, thank you.\nAnd bye."}

So.\nThat\u2019s my Miss Arzner story.\nShe was a wonderful, wonderful lady\nthat we all admired so much.\nAnd are lucky\nthat we had that time with her.\nWell, No\u00ebl Coward is a wonderful\nplaywright and songwriter.\nAnd, when I did The Godfather,\nI sort of got\ngot to be so well known\nat a young age that they wanted me\u2013\nThey offered me many opportunities\nto direct operas or plays.\nSo I did do a play,\nand it was\na play by No\u00ebl Coward\ncalled Private Lives.\nAnd I did it with a sort of\nunusual twist to it.\n[00:05:00]\nAnd I\u2019m going to apply\nthat same twist\non this new material\nthat I\u2019m looking at.\nBasically, art is...\nand some great artists have said it,\nI mean, the great German\npoet and playwright\nand scientist Goethe said\nhe\u2019s only interested in works he reads\nthat he can make use of,\nthat he can\nincorporate into his own work, and\nisn\u2019t that what we do?\nYou know,\nyou see a film and...\nLike I saw\nAntonioni\u2019s Blow-Up\nand I said,\n\u201cI want to make a film like that.\u201d\nAnd so I made The Conversation.\nSo, all of us are\non the shoulders of giants.\nAnd hopefully will provide\nthat same kind of inspiration to the,\nto the wonderful\nyoung people coming along.\nAnd the truth of the matter is that\ncinema art always changes.\nAnd, you know, the...\nthe cinema of our grandchildren\nis going to be\nout there on the edge of\nalmost we\u2019re not going to be able\nto even understand it.\n[00:06:01]\nIt\u2019s going to be so different.\nAnd I have a great\nenjoyment trying to imagine\nwhat that will be like.\nSo, thank you so much for\nthis invitation to stand in a closet,\nand I hope that I\u2019ve offered\na few thoughts\nthat might be\nintriguing or helpful to you."}

Are you kidding me?\nSo you get to look at her.\nIf you like guys,\nit\u2019s got Nino Castelnuovo in it,\nand he\u2019s just as beautiful as she is.\nYou can swap back and forth: who do\nyou like better on a particular viewing?\nThey\u2019re both so beautiful.\nAnd this film is not cotton candy,\nalthough the pink in it\nis cotton-candy colored.\nAnd the use of colors in this thing\nare bananas.\nProbably the most amazing\u2026\nI mean, it was like this\nand then you had to wait a while\nand then you had Kie\u015blowski,\nand since then\nnobody\u2019s been doing color like them.\nTo make something that even flirted\nwith the quality of this would just be\u2026\n[00:02:01]\nis a life\u2019s work.\nYou can spend your life doing that.\nNot the whole Before Trilogy,\nbut the final one.\nSharon Horgan and I were writing\nthe first season of the show Catastrophe,\nand my wife said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s watch Before Midnight.\u201d\nAnd so she puts it on\nand watching I\u2019m like, \u201cOh my God.\u201d\nAs soon as it was over, I called Sharon,\nI was like, \u201cPut down your quill.\nWe have to retool everything\nbecause the ultimate work of art\nabout a marriage has just been made,\nand if we think that\nwe\u2019re gonna play in that arena,\nthen we got to study this playbook.\u201d\nBefore Midnight is such a spectacular,\nhorribly accurate picture of a marriage.\nIt made me\nlove being married\neven more than I already did.\nEven though people who aren\u2019t married\nwould watch this and be like,\n\u201cThat looks awful.\u201d But don\u2019t\u2026\nYou\u2019re not supposed to be happy.\nBeing married isn\u2019t about\u2013\nNo one\u2019s happy, whether single or married.\nIt\u2019s not about that.\n[00:03:02]\nBut the whole world that\ncan be contained in a marriage\nis accurately captured\nin this masterpiece by Richard Linklater\nand Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy.\nI revere the three of them individually.\nPut \u2019em together?\nI mean\u2026\nThis is three films\nthat Andre\u0301 Gregory and Wallace Shawn\nmade together.\nBut the only one I\u2019m featuring right now\nis Vanya on 42nd Street,\nsimply because it was\na very important film for me.\nIt just blew my mind because it was\nthe filming of the rehearsal of a play.\nLike, Wallace Shawn and Andre\u0301 Gregory\nand friends\nhad been rehearsing\nUncle Vanya by Chekhov for years.\nI don\u2019t know if it was even towards\nthe goal of necessarily performing it.\nThey\u2019re just kind of workshopping it.\nSo they did that.\nThen Louis Malle heard about it and was\nlike, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I film you doing this?\u201d\nAnd so he films them.\nAnd so it\u2019s like a story within a story\nwithin a story.\n[00:04:00]\nSo you know it\u2019s not real.\nAnd I love films\nthat are open about their artifice.\nLike, these are not\u2026\nThis is not a Russian landowner.\nIt\u2019s totally Wallace Shawn,\nwho you saw get off the subway and\nwalk into the theater and do the thing.\nBut you immediately forget that\nbecause you\u2019re watching Chekhov\nbeing directed by Andre\u0301 Gregory\nbeing directed by Louis Malle.\nSo you\u2019ve got all their stink on it.\nAnd it\u2019s just a beautiful, beautiful film\nthat really taught me a lot\nabout storytelling.\nThank you Criterion Closet for existing\nand the Criterion Channel\nand the Criterion team\nfor keeping the art of cinema alive.\nYou perform a vital service\nand we\u2019re all very grateful. Thank you."}

came to\nLondon went to London uh because I only\nsaw British and American movies when I\ngrew up in\nManchester and\nuh suddenly I came to L in 1960\nwam I discovered World Cinema very soon\num I came\nacross bicycle\nthieves which is I mean you know I grew\nup in this Urban environment I didn't\nknow that films that really were about\nthe real world existed I used to sit in\ncinema thinking wouldn't it be great if\nyou had a film where the people were\nlike real people I didn't know that this\nwas made when I was quite a little boy\nit's fantastic film that just and yet\nyou know it's not Slice of Life natural\nnot Slice of Life naturalism it's a very\n[00:01:00]\nheightened poetic film but boy doesn't\nhave to get down to it so bicycle\nthieves great\nfilm\num of course at the time it you know at\nthat point it was about the newel vag\nthe explosion of you know\nuh truo Gada and all the guys and\nthere's this extraordinary film it vivra\nSav now this is a film about a\nprostitute in Paris it's a very uh\nidiosyncratic film but the thing of\ngetting out there and getting to the\nkind of the raw core of life even though\nit's a very constructed film uh it's\nvery it's a very remarkable film and uh\nof course apart from anything else um we\nwere all uh at the time us Lads deeply\nin love with Anna Karina there she is\ngood so that's very important important\naspect of films\n[00:02:04]\num I was a film I was a film\nstudent and I lived in\nthis uh these rooms just off Tottenham\nCourt Road in London and there was a lot\nof Foss going on because they were\nshooting this movie it was\ncalled the hard day\nnight and uh I watched them shooting it\nyou know and I think there's even a shot\nof my flat\nin the film basically very exciting I\nwas a film student at the time and you\nknow it's not it's not one of the great\nfilms but I've got a great soft spot for\nit and what is great is that Richard\nLester had really he was inspired by\nwhat was happening across the channel in\nthe continent you know it's a film about\nreally getting out there and capturing\nthings in a spontaneous way although\nit's not my kind of film I've got a lot\nof respect for it energy really and it's\n[00:03:01]\nlook great great looking\nfilm now here is ozu the great Japanese\ndirector late spring I just love this\nfilm I love all his films and in a way\num he's a kind of inspiration and a sort\nof influence I mean he just he really\nknows how to look at families and real\nlife and place and relationships and\ncharacter with a very ordered but\ncompassionate uh ability and I I love\nthis film a lot\ngreat um now I see over\nhere this is very\nremarkable this is zuu\njudex by franu now this is a completely\ndifferent sort of film I love the these\nfilms I mean foard too is a great\nfavorite of M uh these guys that made\n[00:04:01]\nthese\nfilms in the early part of you know\nreally around the time of the first\nworld war completely inventive an\nextraordinary way of confronting the\nmedium and really Reinventing it and\nthis is weird as it is and again in\ninverted comments not my kind of film\nbut still I think it's great and it's\nvery entertaining very\njolly Milos Foreman great filmmaker\nuh there's the fireman's ball that's\ngreat this is this is life you know life\npeople you know with all their faults\nand all and Milos captures them uh it's\nvery funny it's very real uh\nit's it's a natural energy I love it I\nlove those early films those Czech\nmovies uh actually I think he's all his\nfilms are great but this is probably my\nfavorite the fireman's ball I it and you\n[00:05:00]\nreally get what it soundss like it's\nit's very good very funny uh very\npolitical and full of beans and energy\nfireman's B he B\ngreat I had an operation and I was laid\nup in bed for quite a stretch for about\ntwo weeks and every night they showed a\nchapter an episode of Berlin Alexander\nplants which is\nphenomenal uh I'm great it's great that\nit's out here in a in a box all all 13\nepisodes this is a film making I me fast\nbinder what an eccentric what a genius\num what a great filmmaker again you know\ncapturing life life out there on the\nstreet here it is Berlin Alexander Platz\nI love it it's great so here's the film\nthat got us\nall this is the film that I mean I went\n[00:06:00]\nto see this jul Jim true\npH I went to see it with friend of mine\nand this girl we were both in love with\nand of course the irony is that's what\nthe film's all about um you know again\nyou know you just wanted you just we\nwere all in love with Jean Moro and uh\nit's a great you know the thing that's\nexceptional about this film about Jim is\nof course you know one was sad well the\ngreat thing about the lville VAR is that\nthey made the films up you know people\ndidn't adapt novels this is an\nadaptation of a novel but the film is\nfar greater than the Nolla that it's\nbased on and it's just a great film\nabout so many things not least the\npassage of time and growing up and uh\nit's a great period film and it's a very\nmoving film and it's got a wonderful\nscore by George delu and right next to\nit on your shelf is a quite different\n[00:07:01]\nfilm divorce Italian style which is one\nof the funniest films there is with\nmarchella mastriani whom we don't always\nsee as a comedian being hilarious and I\nthink this is a film if you really want\nto laugh this is a film to watch divorce\nItalian\nstyle and that's as much as I have to\nsay"}

one of the Great\nMoments of my life so I'm going to go\nshopping and take you along for the ride\nI'm starting with Moonstruck I think\nit's my all-time favorite movie I think\nit's one of the greatest screenplays\never written I think every performance\nin this movie is Pitch Perfect and\nwhenever I am in need of inspiration I\nput it on and anytime I meet someone new\nand they haven't seen it I will sit down\nwith them and watch it and that I think\nis the joy of movie making and movie\nwatching so we move on Tokyo story if\nyou have not watch it watch it I watched\nit when I was very young and didn't\nunderstand it and then the older I get\nthe more I do understand it and the more\nI love it just a dream one of the\ngreatest movies ever made I also want to\nsay that in film School our film history\nclass was at 9:00 a.m. on a Monday\n[00:01:00]\nmorning which meant that all of us would\nimmediately fall asleep the minute we\ngot into a dark theater and like a black\nand white film came on which is a\nhorrible thing to say but you know what\nI'm in the closet I'm telling the truth\nso I'm still playing catchup from all of\nthose films that I unfortunately slept\nthrough because whose schedule was a\nscreening at a 9:00 a.m. with a you know\nI was\n18 so the piano teacher\num it's not a comedy and when I worked\nat a video store I would often recommend\nit to people um because I thought it was\nlike an impressive movie to recommend to\nsomeone as like a young person um often\ntimes I'd recommend\nto families\num not quite knowing I hadn't seen it at\nthe\ntime so I was kind of like the cover\nlooks you know what I mean it's like an\nit looks like an important movie and\nthen I saw it and was like oh no\n[00:02:00]\num not kid-friendly\nit's as good as I hoped it would be um I\nwould now not recommend it for family\nviewing but unbelievable\nperformances and it is\nuh gosh it packs a\npunch wish I could take back some of\nthose recommendations uh from the video\nstore but you know\nwhat\nelection this was one of those movies\nthat made\nme realize that actors make very very\nsmart choices ree Witherspoon's choice\nto make this movie coming off of\neverything that she had been previously\nknown for I thought was so great it was\nsuch a smart move she was so brilliant\nin it and it also show showed a kind of\nlike professional\nfearlessness which I think as actors you\nhope that you you get the opportunity to\nexpress so election reys I love you\n[00:03:01]\none of the great love stories ever told\nI could watch this movie over and over\nand over again I mean it goes without\nsaying Love and Basketball always and\nforever watch it if you\nhaven't\nweekend this was probably one of the\nfirst films that I saw that really spoke\nto like gay storytelling in a way that\ndidn't feel heavy-handed it didn't feel\nkind of\nwe were telling the story um it was the\nfirst time that I just saw people\nexisting in a way that felt so real and\nuh owe a lot to Andrew and this is\napparently director approved so Andrew\nthank you um in advance for letting me\ntake this home and for this beautiful\nbeautiful movie day Trippers Parker\nposie is someone who I mean I I have\ntried in my life to watch every single\none of her movies one of the Great\n[00:04:00]\nactors of her time our time my time\nanyway watch this movie watch the entire\nParker posie catalog frankly um you can\nstart here it's a good it's a good place\nto start so The Virgin Suicides has a\nvery special place in my heart I was um\ntaking a Film Production summer camp in\nToronto Canada and we were asked um\nwhether we wanted to go on a field trip\nand the field trip was to the set of a\nmovie that at the time we didn't know we\ndidn't know what the movie was but it\nturned out to be the Virgin Suicides and\nI remember like sitting I must have been\nlike 16 or 17 sitting with my film\nsummer camp talking to Josh Hartnett who\nwas about to shoot that scene in the\npool and I remember him saying like it's\nreally nice to meet you all I am now\ngoing to come out in the tiniest pair of\nswim shorts you've ever seen in your\nlife\n[00:05:00]\num which I was like you know you got to\ndo what you got to do I guess uh anyway\nit was like the first taste of film\nmaking and I never got to meet\nSophia on the set of this movie but I\nremember thinking like what a generous\nthing to invite a Film Production Camp\nto your set um and her support funnily\nenough has like carried through my whole\ncareer when shitz Creek was in its last\nseason we got got uh like a letter I\nguess from her saying how much she loved\nthe show and wanted to send us Champagne\nFor the last day of shooting and this\nfull circle moment of like being on set\nfor this movie being so affected by her\nwork and then having her kind of\ncongratulate our show on its last day\nwith champagne it was like it was a\npinch me great moment and I've only met\nher once and it was in passing and I\ndidn't get to quite tell her how I felt\n[00:06:00]\nbut Sophia thank you for your generosity\nand thank you for playing like a big\npart in the inspiration of my career I\nthink for my\nlast I mean I could be here for quite\nliterally 7\nhours so I think what I'm going to\ndo is just close my eyes and pick but I\nthink I'm going to go on this\nwall\nbecause there are some older movies that\nI have not seen on this\nwall and so I'm going to just close the\neyes I'm going to just close the eyes\nand kagam Musha\nkurasawa it's time I have not seen it it\nis time I watch\nit and this has been such a\nthrill thank you very\nmuch"}

It\u2019s in Gone Baby Gone also.\nAstonishing.\nAn extraordinary filmmaker and humanist.\nAnd kind of the ability to create empathy\nand understand other people,\nI feel like he almost introduced\ninto cinema.\nIt\u2019s sort of the\u2013\nto me, it\u2019s the heart of\nwhy movies are brilliant\nand unique and wonderful.\nLet\u2019s see, Miller\u2019s Crossing.\nThe Carter Burwell score\nis so haunting and evocative.\nThe image of the hat drifting through\nthe autumn woods and, you know,\nTurturro begging for his life.\nIt brought style\nand also emotional realism,\ncoupled in a way where\nit was sort of uniquely my\u2013\n[00:01:02]\nwhat I thought was the Coen brothers.\nIt was part of\nthe formative period of my life\nwhen I was watching movies\nand inspired to want to be a director.\nDazed and Confused. Here\u2019s a movie I\u2019m in.\nThis was a wonderful experience for me.\nIt really taught me in doing it that\u2026\nBecause Rick Linklater, the director,\nkind of invited us to be authors\nand participate and write and improvise,\nhe made every actor in it a partner\nand, as a director myself,\nI\u2019ve really latched onto that lesson\nand tried to continue with that.\nI remember he sent us a note\nthat said, \u201cIf this movie is\nproduced as written, it would be\na massive underachievement.\u201d\nI had never seen humility in that way\nor that kind of approach,\nand that way of inviting\nyour collaborators in\nwas amazing.\nBadlands. Terry Malick made this movie.\nIt\u2019s one of his great films.\nCoupling sort of rebellion\nand youth and suburbia\nwith this strange, kind of\nmonstrous-feeling violence\nthat seems inexplicable.\n[00:02:01]\nAnd he really captured the sort of\nboth the beauty and the pain\nof that place and time and that idea.\nAnd he\u2019s just an incredible\u2026\nAh, God, Steven Soderbergh, Traffic.\nJust seminal.\nIt\u2019s about the drug trade\nand its many impacts and manifestations.\nThis movie made\na massive impression on me.\nGod, this is unbelievable.\nI can\u2019t even like\u2026\nBeing in here is so\u2026\nHollywood Shuffle.\nRobert Townsend made this movie.\nIt\u2019s about being\na Black actor in Hollywood.\nI found it so fascinating,\nand I still remember that line at the end,\n\u201cThere\u2019s always work at the post office.\u201d\nIt was the first time I saw somebody define\nthe ability to choose\nor not choose what they did,\ntake authorship\nover their life and their art.\nAnd it remains very meaningful to me.\nGod, Trainspotting, Danny Boyle.\nThis is an incredible film.\nHeroin addiction and Scotland.\nAnd, you know\u2026\n\u201cA country colonized by wankers.\u201d\nIt was just amazing.\n[00:03:01]\nThat\u2019s a bad Scottish accent,\nbut those are my ancestors, so\nI feel some bizarre affinity\nfor the place.\nAnd, God, it was such a good movie.\nSpike Lee\u2019s Malcolm X\nwith Denzel Washington.\nThere is not a performance\nI can think of that\u2019s better than this.\nI remember where I was\nwhen I watched the movie,\nand I remember when I walked out,\nI thought, \u201cI want to be a better man.\u201d\nIt was the first time movies touched me\nin that kind of a profound way.\nBull Durham, this is a\u2026\na great sports movie.\nIt\u2019s a genre that I really like.\nAnd one of the things\nI love about it is that\nit was about the sort of the dignity\nand courage and humanity\nof people who aspire to greatness\nand maybe,\nyou know, not reached it,\nbut found a place to kind of\nbe at peace with that and who they are.\nI found it beautiful and heartbreaking.\nI mean, Fast Times at Ridgemont High,\nprobably the best\nteen high school movie ever made.\nBig influence on Dazed and Confused.\nIncredible performances.\n[00:04:00]\nI mean, chief among them,\nSean Penn as Spicoli.\nYou know, like,\n\u201cOnce I cruise history, I\u2019m not coming\nto your side of the building.\u201d\n\u201cMr. Hand.\u201d Like\u2026\n\u201cGet out of here, Curtis,\nI don\u2019t hear you unless you knock.\u201d\nThis is a great film about\nAmerican high school life.\nSilence of the Lambs is probably\nthe best classic serial killer, like\u2026\nThere\u2019s stuff in this movie that\u2019s been\nborrowed by a thousand other movies.\nI\u2019ve tried to rip it off.\nIt\u2019s just an incredible film.\nJonathan Demme did\na spectacular job, of course.\nWith Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter,\nTed Levine as Buffalo Bill,\nand Jodie Foster kind of carrying it\nin this spectacular way\nas the protagonist.\nIt\u2019s just an example of\nhow you make a really great\npop, scary, wonderful film\nthat\u2019s smart and terrifying and engaging.\nSo this disc, the Criterion\u2026\nI was surprised when I heard Criterion\nwas doing Armageddon.\nI didn\u2019t think of it\nas that kind of movie when we did it.\n[00:05:03]\nAnd in retrospect, now, I feel like\nmaybe my best work in my career\nis the commentary on this disc.\nPeople approach me to talk about\nthe commentary on this disc\nas much as they do\nmovies that I\u2019ve been in.\nAnd it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know any better\nthan to be really honest.\nBut I won\u2019t spoil it for those of you\nwho are interested. It is a\u2026\nIt is an achievement that I am proud of\nand didn\u2019t intend to be as good\nas I now think it is at the time.\nCriterion, when is the 4K coming out?\nThis movie, The Elephant Man,\nby David Lynch,\nis the first and only time\nI ever saw my father cry.\nMovie about what it means\nto be a human being.\nAnd it\u2019s heartbreaking and beautiful and\u2026\nand it\u2019s tied to\na very personal memory for me.\nYou know, it\u2019s\u2026\nThat\u2019s probably a good note to end on."}

{"id":"UUM9Wrn2F3c","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUM9Wrn2F3c","title":"David Cronenberg's Closet Picks","subtitles":"[00:00:02]\nI\u2019m David Cronenberg,\na Canadian filmmaker,\nborn and raised in Toronto\nand still live there\nand have shot many of my films there.\nAnd in Toronto I always felt\nthat I was halfway between\nHollywood and Europe in terms of films.\nAnd when I started to make movies myself,\nI think that\u2019s where I found myself,\nbetween those two poles.\nSo one very particular\nand interesting film for me\nwas this film:\nFederico Fellini\u2019s La strada.\nAnd the reason\nthat it had a special meaning\nfor me was that\nin Toronto \u2013\nwe\u2019re talking about the 1940s, 1950s \u2013\nevery Saturday there would be a\u2026\nlike a swarm of lemmings,\nthere were children\nwho would come to a particular cinema\ncalled the Pylon.\nAnd one day I came out of that cinema,\n[00:01:01]\nhaving seen the traditional kind of\nwhat for us were kids\u2019 movies,\nand across the street from the Pylon\nwas a new theater,\na very small one called the Studio,\nand it only showed\nItalian films in Italian,\nthere were people coming out\nof a screening\nthat had happened at the Studio,\nand it was adults only, no children,\nand they were coming out onto the street\nand there were weeping,\nmen and women sobbing, crying.\nAcross the street to see\nwhat the film was\nthat had that effect on these people\nand it was La strada.\nAnd so, of course,\nmany years later I saw La strada\nand then I was crying on the street myself\nand I thought\nthat was the moment that I realized\nthat film had that kind of power.\nIt made a difference to me\nand my entire film career.\nSo, La strada.\nEnglish films were a big influence, too,\nand they had their own particular tone.\n[00:02:00]\nThey were very theatrical in some ways,\nbut they had a really special power.\nAnd one in particular for me was\nthis one:\nOdd Man Out,\nwith an actor I absolutely adore,\nJames Mason.\nI would have loved to work with him.\nHe had the most wonderful\nvoice and presence.\nDirected by Carol Reed.\nAnd it was\nan incredibly powerful, melancholy,\nsurprising\nfilm that was\u2026\nas I say, had a particular English feel\nthat you would not find in\nthe rest of Europe\nor certainly not in Hollywood also.\nSo, Odd Man Out.\nFantastic to have this film in my hand.\nBut, as we said, there were two poles.\nAnd there was a European pole,\nbut there was also the American pole.\nNow, American filmmaking, of course,\nwas not just Hollywood,\nand a film that I could relate to more\n[00:03:02]\nin terms of my own filmmaking was\u2026\nDavid Lynch\u2019s film Eraserhead.\nVery American and saying\nsome really interesting\nkind of sublime things\nabout American culture\nand the American ethos and zeitgeist\nthat you wouldn\u2019t see in a Hollywood film,\nbut you also wouldn\u2019t\nsee it in a European film.\nThis is a really special film\nthat had a big impact on me.\nI can\u2019t say that it was an influence\nbecause I had already been making films\nby this time, but it was\u2026\nit was significant for me.\nAnd I met David\nand we got along very well.\nI went with him to Bob\u2019s Big Boy,\nwhere we would eat hamburgers for lunch.\nAnd we got along very well.\nAnd it\u2019s a really\u2026\nof course, it\u2019s a tragedy\nthat he died so young.\nEraserhead.\nThis immense collection.\nQuite fantastic and really heavy.\nAnd you could use it in your workout.\n[00:04:00]\nBergman also was one of the greats\nfor anybody who felt that\nfilm was art.\nAnd, in particular, Hour of the Wolf,\na very, very dark, depressing film,\nwhich was great,\nhad a special meaning for me because,\nwhen I was making my film The Fly,\nthere was a moment when\nthe Jeff Goldblum character,\nwho has now sort of fused with the fly DNA\nand has strange physical capabilities,\ncould climb up onto a wall\nand hang from a ceiling.\nAnd I remembered that Bergman\nhad done that\nin Hour of the Wolf,\na scene with a man\nwho is experiencing such anguish\nthat his anguish\nallows him to walk up a wall\nand onto a ceiling.\nAnd I was wondering,\n\u201cHow did he do that physically?\u201d\nbecause now\nI was going to do the same thing\nin a science-fiction movie\nwith quite a different tone.\nAnd so I watched Hour of the Wolf again.\n[00:05:02]\nAnd so I felt a kinship with Bergman and\nI think John Landis told me\nwhen he went to\nBergman\u2019s house on his island,\nhis special Swedish island,\nthat amongst his\ncollection of DVDs\nthere was a DVD of The Fly.\nSo I thought,\n\u201cOkay, Bergman and I, we are\u2026\nwe are blood brothers.

Scott,\nwho almost ruins the movie,\nno one knows\nthey\u2019re making a comedy.\nAnyway, my single favorite\nmovie ever made.\nNow, weirdly, if I\u2019m not mistaken,\nalmost like\nthe same week practically,\nFail Safe came out.\nHenry Fonda was brilliant in it.\nI assume it...\nAm I right?\nWas it Henry Fonda?\nI\u2019m doing great.\nI love this movie.\nIt makes me so depressed.\nSo, two movies.\nSame plot.\nI was the cinematographer\non Miller\u2019s Crossing.\nTrey Wilson,\nwho is Nathan Arizona\nin Raising Arizona,\nMiller\u2019s Crossing was written\nfor him in the lead.\nJoel, Ethan, and I were driving out\nto Lake Pontchartrain\nwith my wife, Sweetie,\nto look at a location.\nI was driving with Sweetie.\nJoel and Ethan were in front of me.\n[00:02:00]\nI was the only one\nwho owned a cell phone\n\u2018cause the Coens\njust don\u2019t like to spend money on\nwasteful things like cell phones.\nSo, I got a call from\nour casting director who said,\n\u201cTrey just had a massive\nbrain hemorrhage\nand was not going to make it.\u201d\nAnd the next day he died.\nAnd Joel and Ethan were two weeks\nbefore shooting,\nhad to find a replacement.\nThey found Albert Finney.\nAlbert came in\nwith less than two weeks\nand knew every single line of dialog.\nAnd here\u2019s a personal story.\nSweetie and I,\nmy wife, Sweetie, and I\ngot married\nat the wrap party\nfor Miller\u2019s Crossing.\nAfter we were married,\nwith me weeping uncontrollably,\nAlbert got the microphone.\nWe were all given\nglasses of champagne.\nAlbert made a toast\nthat had a lot of metaphors\nabout driftwood and floating\ndown the river.\n[00:03:00]\nBlah, blah, blah.\nAnd then he said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s all raise a glass\nto Sweetie and Barry.\u201d\nThe entire Mississippi River\nlit up in fireworks.\nAlbert paid for a barge of fireworks.\nIt cost him $7,000.\nOver the next 20 years,\nI would occasionally run into Albert\nat some restaurant\nand Albert would say,\n\u201cAre you still married to Sweetie?\u201d\nI go, \u201cYes, Albert.\u201d\nAnd he said, \u201cYou better be.\nThose fucking fireworks\ncost me a fortune.\u201d\nSo, Miller\u2019s Crossing,\nperhaps the best lit movie\nI\u2019ve ever shot. And if\nyou look at it carefully, you\u2019ll see\nthat I never motivated the light.\nYou\u2019ll see a lamp right here.\nBut the main light\nwill be coming from this side\nbecause that side made\nGabe Byrne look better,\nin spite of the fact\nthat it was not motivated.\nSo you don\u2019t have to motivate light\nto make something look beautiful.\nIf you haven\u2019t watched\nthe Criterion Collection\nBlu-ray\n[00:04:02]\nof Blood Simple\u2019s\nadded additional discussion\nbetween Joel, Ethan, and I,\nI asked Criterion\nand they found us a telestrator.\nSo I literally can circle things\nas we\u2019re talking.\nAnd what\u2019s great\nabout watching the\nthe supplemental, director-approved\nDVD special edition\nis Joel and Ethan spend\nthe entire time making fun of me\nand I spend the entire time\nmaking fun of them.\nAs soon as it came out,\nI got an email from Bill Hader\ntelling me how much he loved\nthe supplemental commentary.\nSo if you ever get bored\nwith Blood Simple\nand think, \u201cI can\u2019t watch it\none more time,\nthe camera operating sucks,\u201d\nwatch it just for Joel, Ethan, and I\nmaking fun of each other.\nThin Blue Line.\nErrol Morris.\nI shot part of\none of his documentaries\nand what was interesting\nabout his technique\n[00:05:02]\nis, he sets up the camera\u2013\nNow he uses a special device\nwith a two-way mirror and all that.\nBut then he just sat\nreally near the camera.\nHe used to be a detective.\nI\u2019d roll camera and Errol Morris\nwould say\nnothing.\nHe\u2019d sit there and sit there\nand the person being interviewed\nwould be waiting for a question.\nErrol wouldn\u2019t ask one.\nAnd eventually, without fail,\nthe interviewee would say,\n\u201cOkay, I guess you want to know\nif I killed my wife,\u201d or whatever it was.\nBut it was a brilliant technique.\nHe just\u2013 just sits on it,\nnever interrupts\nand just lets that silence live.\nAnd also, the other thing\nI love about this movie\nis, I love Philip Glass.\nI love his music.\nI love the tension of,\n\u201cWhen will he ever fucking\nresolve this chord?\u201d\nSo here\u2019s an example.\nI think he does resolve a chord\nwithin The Thin Blue Line.\nSo check it out\njust for the tension\n[00:06:01]\nof his soundtrack.\nI now have an amazing bag of movies\nthat I want to see again\nand some that\nI want to learn about.\nI love, love\nthe Criterion Collection.\nSo thrilled to be back here\nwith them.\nThey\u2019re just a great company."}

So,\nwhen we were\njust a small group of nerds,\nwe would just covet\nevery new LaserDisc that came out.\nAnd here we are still.\nAll right.\nToday is the release date\nof Paper Moon, so I am excited\nthat I get to be one of the first people\nto talk about it.\nPaper Moon.\nProbably one of the strongest,\nmost economical openings.\nIn, I\u2019d say 10 seconds, you are\ninterested in character.\nIn about 30 seconds,\nyou are intrigued by the dilemma.\nAnd three minutes in,\nyou\u2019re rooting for the plot.\nAnd then ten minutes in, you are\nblindly allegiant to this relationship.\nI mean, I can\u2019t think of a movie\nthat does that more\nimpactfully, more powerfully,\nmore entertainingly.\n[00:01:01]\nThis is just a great, great,\ngreat, great, great, great movie.\nSo, putting that first in the bag.\nBrazil, 1985.\nIt\u2019s kind of known in the lore\nthat he had\na cut of this\nthat he wanted to release\nbut Universal didn\u2019t,\nand that he took the film hostage.\nSo he got in a van\nand he drove up to CalArts,\nwhich was where I was\nwith my fellow students\nthat some became\ncoworkers with me at Pixar.\nMy production designer\non Toy Story and Finding Nemo\nand WALL\u2022E was Ralph\u2013\nthe late, great Ralph Eggleston.\nHe was the student projectionist.\nAnd he told us that\nTerry Gilliam was coming up\nand he was going to show some film,\nand it just made\nsuch a difference\u2013\nI mean, I was already a Monty Python fan,\nalready a Time Bandits fan,\nbut this film has just...\nand I think you can see it in WALL\u2022E,\njust the influence this had.\n[00:02:01]\nI can\u2019t say enough about this film.\nI love this film.\nLove, love, love, love, love, love.\nOkay, Local Hero.\nI come from a small fishing village\nand I just totally got it.\nEvery line is quotable.\nIt was probably, to me,\none of the greatest things\nBurt Lancaster did near the end\nof his career as Felix Happer.\nBut this, this movie is\u2013\njust speaks to my heart.\nI mean, if I could ever be involved\nin a movie that had this\nfeeling that Bill Forsyth captured,\nI\u2019d finish. I\u2019d be done.\nWorst Person in the World.\nThis is a more recent film, \u201921.\nThis is going to sound weird.\nIt\u2019s a great movie on its own.\nBut my favorite film in the world\nis Lawrence of Arabia.\nAnd people think it\u2019s for\nthe spectacle, the scope, the scale.\nBut it\u2019s because\nthe theme of it is, \u201cWho am I?\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s really the closest\nthat you get to a novel,\nwhere it\u2019s the internal desire\nto figure yourself out.\nSo, you\u2019re\u2013 all your choices\nas a protagonist are\nseemingly reactive\nto things happening to you,\n[00:03:00]\nbut what you\u2019re invested in\nas an audience member is,\n\u201cWhat will that person\nchoose to do based on\njust trying to find their identity\nas they encounter\nthese choices and obstacles?\u201d\nAnd this is very similar\nin that respect.\nAnd I just found this\nthe most amazing internal journey\nof somebody just trying to figure out\ntheir place in the world.\nIt\u2019s staring right at me,\nso Defending Your Life.\nThis is a perfect comedy.\nCame out in \u201991.\nWe were a year out from really\ngetting serious writing Toy Story.\nSo all the movies that came out\naround \u201991, \u201992, \u201993 really\u2013\nlike Midnight Run, things like that,\nhad a big influence on our\nlearning curve of trying to put comedy\ninto a feature-length movie.\nI want to believe\nit\u2019s why I fell in love with\nthe concept of Albert Brooks\nbeing the voice of a fish.\nTo have had the chance to\nbe a front-row audience member\nfor a one-man show\n[00:04:00]\nin the recording studio with him\nfor close to four to five years total\nwas one of the biggest privileges\nof my career.\nAnd...\nBut this movie is just,\nit\u2019s just flawless in my mind.\nProbably saving the best for last.\nMatewan.\nMy senior year of film school,\nI remember seeing an ad for this\nin the LA Weekly, and...\njust\u2013 and I think it was a poster\nlooked similar to this,\nand just kind of being intrigued\nand took a chance,\nthat\u2019s how I saw My Life as a Dog,\nit\u2019s how I saw Jean de Florette,\nManon of the Spring.\nTook in a matinee by myself.\nAnd I did this and was blown away.\nJohn Sayles has a way, I would say\nRichard Linklater has the same,\njust a way of doing\nmulti-protagonist movies.\nHe just loves to make the worlds\nsort of greater and richer\nthan just the singular protagonist\nor multi-protagonist that you\u2019re following\nand you feel it everywhere.\nThe other thing that was huge\nis that he published a book then,\nin the same year,\ncalled Thinking in Pictures.\n[00:05:01]\nAnd it was so hard to find\na how-to book about how\nlow-budget movies were made,\nand just\u2013\nand it was real\nnuts-and-bolts and practical\nand spoke in a common man\u2019s language,\nand I\u2019ve kept onto that book.\nSo, if you only take one movie away\nfrom this whole pitch: Matewan."}

And it's a strange\nblend of almost a docu documentation of\na life blended with art. And I think\nit's structurally one of the most\nsophisticated films ever written and\nshot. Oh.\nOh, this is\nfantastic. All that jazz. Bob\nFSY. High and low by\nCorsava. Sometimes when you're film nerd\nand you've gone to Cinema Tech and\nbought DVDs and Blu-rays and VHS's for a\nlong time in your life, you think that\nyou're uh oh, I've seen it all.

That's that's the great\nthing about this collection as well that\nthere's still lots to see. Um, but High\n[00:01:00]\nand Low by Kurosava to me is like the\nperfect entertainment film. It's a great\nchase, three acts, uh, a perfect script,\na sense of a film being allowed to be\ndifferent things yet very uh, developing\nin its dramaty. Let's keep going. I I'm\nworried that we'll run out of time\nbecause there's so much here I want. You\nknow, the Yantrails, The Immigrants, and\nthe New Land.

It seems like this is my day\nfor Scandinavian cinema. Okay, silent\nmovie. Victor Scho's The Phantom\nCarriage. I know this for a fact was on\nB Ingar Bergman's top 10 list. Swedish\num silent classic. It says here 1921.\n[00:02:01]\nYeah, it's a it's an experimental film\nagain with structure.

only filmmaker he really\ncares about and\nuh you really see that in these films\nwhich are very brisonian like they're\nkind of like you know the actors are\nbasically functioning as models the\nseventh continent is\none of the most perfect films ever made\nand very upsetting\num Benny's video is a great film about\nNazi Youth and the 71 fragments of a\nchronology of chance\num is it is you know a great kind of\nlike trial run for what he ended up\ndoing\nwith code unknown daisies one of one of\n[00:02:01]\nthe many many incredible Czech films\nthat came out in the 60s amazing ending\nit makes you sick\nthere's an argument to be made that cure\nby kiyoshi Kurosawa is the greatest\nmovie ever made well Mr Klein\nby Joseph Losi is really brilliant one\nof the great Holocaust films and I think\nthe film that gets\nclosest to Kafka just as a\nnightmare of persecution it's really\nlike untoppable the Coker Trilogy is\nincredible the second film here and Life\nGoes On\nis really uh like beyond the Beyond just\nso beautiful and\ntouching and like what I mean you know\nhe's he just takes children very\nseriously uh especially in where's the\nfriend's house but also and life goes on\nand through the olive trees is a great\nmovie about the social politics of like\n[00:03:02]\nbeing on a movie set my friend Dan uh\nrecommended this to me after his friend\nrecommended it to him uh La poisson by\nSasha gitri which has the best\nuh uh opening credit sequence of all\ntime it's it's a Sasha Petri going up to\nall of his uh going up to every member\nof the cast and and uh the crew and\nintroducing them and telling them what\nnot only how much he loves them but why\nhe loves them\nuh\nand uh it's great it's really special\nthe films of Carol Zaman are amazing and\nthere's an animated sequence in Beau is\nafraid\num that nods to\num invention for Destruction which is\nuh like you know astonishing the new\nworld\nI can't find the words but this movie is\n[00:04:01]\nlike immense to me and\num like I never use the word\nTranscendent but but it uh\nbut watching this film was a\nTranscendent experience secret Sunshine\nby Lee Chang dong\num who is I think one of the great\nfilmmakers working now\num I think burning might be my favorite\nfilm of the last like decade and this\nfilm is uh so special and strange I did\nnot know how to take it when I first\nwatched it\num it's uh about a woman who just like\ncannot stop suffering\num and she moves to her dead husband's\nHometown with her son and very early on\nher son is abducted and then killed I'm\nnot I don't think I'm giving anything\naway because it happened so early on\ninto the film\nand there's a scene\n[00:05:01]\nnear the middle of the film it might be\na little bit later than that when she\ngoes to visit\nuh her son's abductor in in prison and\nthat is where the film becomes\nsomething so fascinating and so strange\num that it's really never left me woman\nin the dunes by Hiroshi teshigahara I\nRevisited this during\nuh\nlockdown\num in 2020 and it it it it really struck\nme as the perfect\num Quarantine movie and just one of the\ngreat films about men and women\nhe stopped making films uh to to become\nlike a florist not enough people talk\nabout Che which is\na masterpiece and I think\nStephen soderberg's best film I don't\nknow why it didn't get\n[00:06:00]\nuh\nmore attention\nbecause it really is like I mean just\nit's I I don't know how he made it\num and I think it's why he\nkind of you know uh retired is I think\nit was so disappointing how\nlittle attention the film got\num\nbut uh and I get it I if if I made Shay\nand nobody paid attention\nI would\njust say [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] you and stop\nspeaking of uh unconventional biopics\nthat don't fall into the typical traps\nMishima by Paul Schrader it's I mean\nit's almost definitely the the best film\nhe ever made just I mean what he's doing\nwith artifice here what he's doing with\nstructure it's really\nuh brilliant and when I first saw it it\nwas like shocking bigger than life one\nof James Mason's best performances it's\nvery funny it's very crazy a great kind\n[00:07:01]\nof like uh alarmist pharmaceutical\nmelodrama uh where\nuh by by the end he's um\nhe's he's convinced that he's Abraham\nand he's gonna kill his son\num it's great brand upon the brain\nuh by Guy Madden when I was in film\nSchool\nI\nuh was just like ripping him off\nnon-stop his whole thing is that he\nmakes these films that feel like\num\nthese these lost\nfilms from like the silent era or like\nearly sound days this film I saw\num in theaters it had this uh this\nRoadshow\nuh release\num where they they uh they took it\naround the country I think\num\nwith uh\nthis gang of Foley artists and a live\nOrchestra and different people narrating\n[00:08:01]\nuh and I saw it at the American\ncinematech the Egyptian Theater\nin La\num with udokir narrating and it was\nmaybe the best experience I've ever had\nin a movie theater I'm not gonna take it\nbecause I already own it but I'm gonna\nhold it up for you\nwalk about Walkabout has the best\nopening\nlike the sequence like it's uh\nprologue I don't know what it is it's\nlike this or it's like an overture that\nleads to\num\num like you know a father attempting to\nmurder his children and so like that\nthat

um you know I think as I Was\npreparing for Carmen I um there's you\nknow there's something that I studied in\nparticular is um you know the way that\ncertain directors move the camera and\nstag the scenes and um I found myself\nthrilled to see to find um directors who\nhad really a sense of choreography that\nwas really accomplished and really\ninteresting and you know I wanted to\ntalk a little bit about a few of them so\none of them that um was a great\ninspiration I'll peek here I'll peek on\nthe waterfront by kazen this was quite\nfascinating because kazen um was the\ntheater director in New York and the\nfirst couple of movies he really was\njust shooting um shooting as if it was\ntheater the cameras were still he sort\nof didn't know how to you know what the\ncab could do in terms of enhancing the\naction and you see evolves as he starts\n[00:01:00]\nto make more movies that there's an\nenormous change and how uh he starts to\nmaster this relationship with camera and\nmovement and in films like East of Eden\nand on the waterfront and then you start\nto have these incredible films where um\nthe physicality of the actors is is you\nknow in the relationship to a camera\nthat's\nnever you know never self-conscious\nthat's never there just for virtuosity\nthat's really really you know these\nchoices are always very very specific to\neach scene he actually if you read his\nbiography he really recommended uh\ndirectors to to to go Tech dance to\nwatch\nchoreography um he he really um\nunderstood the importance of you know an\nanalyzing you know how to move people in\ntime and space and how the camera could\nuh could could could be an\nincredible partner in in that movement\nso now I'll pick Tree of Life by Terence\n[00:02:00]\nmik and so that's for you know for\ndifferent reasons it has to do with with\ndance you know in dance um we always say\nyou know you don't want to be you know\nyou want to make dance look like you're\nyou're you're just coming up with it in\nthe moment I mean the best example of\nthat is Fred a Fred a always looked like\nhe was improvising right it's just like\nyeah these these these moments of Grace\nand you never know what's coming next\ncoming you know and it just had this\nthis this is sort of what you want to\nachieve Terry has a way to capture that\nmagical moment I think better than you\nknow anyone else and he does it by just\nhis continuous shooting I've been on S\nthe opportunity to watch him work on set\nyou know the camera keeps rolling and he\nsort of lets the actors walk in all\nkinds of directions and he's just you\nknow it's it's him but it's also the\ncamera operator who has the sensibility\nto the action and just has this this\nability to to to to catch these moments\nthat are completely graceful and\ncompletely unexpected Ed and and catch\n[00:03:00]\nyou know take your breath away so of\ncourse when it comes to movement um it's\nreally important to study Cawa because\nyou know and I would start with the\nfirst film which is sanir rugata which\nis a martial art film there's an\nincredible scen in this of this film\nwhich is this duel between um the two\nthe the lead actor it's it's a combat\nthat takes place on a hill in Moonlight\nuh with just these the grass that's\nflying and it's just an incredible\nincredible scene but throughout you see\nhow bodies roll and fight and fall from\nyou know screen right to screen left and\nhow there's such intelligent cutting and\nmovement and yet he has the ability to\ntake a camera and go from seamlessly\nwith the handle camera to to to to a\ntight shot to White shot to again you\nknow a tight shot and and it never it\nalways has this like incredible like\nperfect connection to movement so\ninterestingly uh a totally different\napproach um to to movement here\n[00:04:00]\nuh because obiously FY choreographer\ndirector um isn't someone who\num really where the the movement isn't\nabout how he moved the camera on on on\nin\nscenes um you know the dances are\ncomplex and they happen on stage and he\nwould essentially capture all these\ndifferent angles and the choreography\nfrom me happened in the edit editing\nroom you know the editing of FY is\nwhat's absolutely phenomenal\num there's a rhythm there's a the\nchoreography he literally creates\nchoreography with the editing for that\nreason it's it's a really important\ndirector to watch that I also also Lov\nobviously cabar is Masterpiece and so\nit's all that\njazz I think it's also interesting to\ntalk when you when you think of of\nmovement and also of of the importance\nof Stillness um uh to talk about\nantonioni which um is a director that\nthat I love for for the the the tension\n[00:05:01]\nthe mystery in these films the things\nthat are\nunsaid I think what I admire here is\nactually how so often he decides to um\nyou know not move the camera and also\nnot necessarily see the character from\nthe front uh but experience the\ncharacter from Over the shoulder the\nback if you're doing it to show that you\ncan create a you know a moment of\nvirtuosity I think it's it's uh you're\nmissing the point I think the idea is\nthat how these elements come together\nreally beautifully and in a way you need\nto be immersed in the picture and the\nemotion and not feel like the camera is\nmoving and and Anon is really great\ngreat director to watch because of these\nchoices actually of not moving the\ncamera\nso last um I pick K squaty I highly\nrecommend it the score is outstanding I\nlisten to it all the time I still listen\nto it all the time I I just you know I\nthink of of Philip Glass a little bit as\n[00:06:00]\nkind of a bethoven you know there's\nsomething about bethoven he always knew\nhow to choose the right next note you\nknow these Melodies are really really\nsimple and yet he creates these very\ncomplex variations with them but there's\na there's a kind of evidence to you know\nwhat note

just\nsaying to the guys from criterion that\nyou had this big book called the Janus\ncollection that they still do which has\nfour DVDs on every page and actually in\nthe documentary they still do it

coming for you in the\nshank and civil wars happening that was\nlike a solace we watched uh-huh we\nwatched The Criterion Collection to get\nfree really tough that patch so this is\nquite lovely you really make it and this\n[00:01:01]\nis the first Mike Lee film I ever saw in\nmy life and it just that came out or we\nwere at college didn't it and I think we\nwere at college everybody's yeah it just\nkind of like just 93 93 yes oh yeah\nabout a year before so this kind of\ndefined our time during film degree is\nBritish filmmaking but it's just so\ngreat that I felt good about where I was\nyou know and that I didn't feel so\nembarrassed and that it because it was\nsuch an amazing film that it was really\nbut if you're in a council flat that\nthat it just kind of it gave you some\nsort of I don't know it's difficult it\njust made it made you feel good because\nit's so clever and then you were like\nwow our poor people down and out like\nbegging in the street can also be smart\nyou know and it it's celebrating the\n[00:02:01]\noutcasts\nand it was really great to watch I am\ngonna pick qez just because I've just\nmoved to Sheffield in the England and\nthe whole tell everyone where you live\nthe whole of the city of Sheffield runs\nall famous now Barry Hines who wrote\nthis and Ken Loach who directed it and I\nwent to the local like art cinema for\nthe first time watched three different\nfilms that they're made together as a\nteam this wasn't one of them there was\none called the gamekeeper at one called\nshouts and whispers or something like\nthat and one called threads that was\ninsane about what would happen if\nsomeone dropped a nuclear bomb on\nSheffield in the 1980s and it was so\nextreme like there was like flesh\nhanging off people screaming it went on\nfor hours and like saw the whole thing\nright through to like 35 years after\nwhere the kids of the people that had\ngot radiation poisoning we're like\n[00:03:00]\ngetting through it and the potato fields\num but this film is probably the best\nthing that they did together and it's\njust incredible like every one of our\nage in the UK has seen this film it's\njust such a iconic bit of British\nculture and its really like captures the\nheartbeat of the north and yeah it's\njust amazing okay since I'm mad oh good\nsince I'm called missing in action I'm\ngonna choose an also I talked about\nCuster I'm gonna choose missing my hosta\ncameras yeah this kind of resonates for\nwhat's going on in Sri Lanka right now\nwe have a lot of the stuff that I talked\nabout and the reason why I'm called\nm.i.a so this is like the first film\nthat connected with that though it's\nbased on a situation in South America\n[00:04:02]\nyou should watch it have you seen it no\nI know it's incredible the\ncinematography and like it's it's kind\nof like real but it's very it the\naesthetic is very\nboom free hmm like if you've seen the\nbone free video oh that's more what is\nbetter look at then I thought maybe you\nshould watch it\nI want to choose deep pang but just\nright here yeah was it that deep and\njust because it's the first time all\nfilm story in this whole closet so\njackpot yards actually sent the script\nto me before he made it to cast me as\nthe goal and then I got fired off the\njob because they said I was too\ngood-looking except that I am in a story\nso they ended up casting a woman in it\nwho was actually Indian she's South\nIndian she wasn't sure ranking at all\nbut I am the actual rank on refugee and\nI doing a cast for the film but he did\n[00:05:00]\nask me he was I was the first person he\nasked but it really you know he was the\nfirst director to bring it into the\nserious film space a cinematic space so\nI just respect him enough that and he's\na great director the Prophet was one of\nmy favorite films ever so I just found\nit extremely flattering and amazing when\nI came in I saw badlands and now I can't\nsee it oh you can't shoot badlands and I\npromise me you won't use badlands I my\nfavorite film yeah cannot choose that\nwhoever finds it first gets it where's\nbadlands give us a clue\nit's order of release and says it's a\ngreat film they would have released it\nway earlier than anything else and be up\nthere it's my favorite film by the way\n[00:06:04]\nso I showed it no I think I saw it first\nand recommended NCE this is what\nTerrence Malick is a genius like this\njust like the most you anything do you\nhave a budget for this it's like\nthree-inch grand or something as\nridiculous I can believe that\nyeah I just find it really dreamy\nremember seeing it the first time and\nthen forgetting what it was and what it\nwas called but remembering like a shot\nof a piano on fire and then that\nxylophone tune that's all the way\nthrough it and just individual images\nlike dreamlike that's an absolutely\nbeautiful film\nI want American movies to get back to\nthis moment and I don't know if it would\never do that but this is just like I've\nmade I could watch this already I didn't\nalways waited yeah I have I put it on\nand I just force him to watch it because\nevery time he is watching like watch\ntransformers like just noise and CGI\n[00:07:04]\nworld then I put this on to be like this\nis real filmmaking and he he's always so\nlike blown away by it like when he when\nhe watches a very like subtle kind of a\nbeautiful film that's just got a perfect\nstoryline and it's a little bit intense\nduring I but I I sort of know right\nthrough it for him so he understands it\nmm-hm and yeah it's just so beautiful\nall right cool that was mine\nthat was my last two great well thank\nyou so much yes i syrian collection\nthank you so much for having us\nand hopefully these this is gonna\ninspire me to

So...\nYou know, I grew up\nin a time where\nthese movies weren\u2019t\nreadily accessible,\nso you\u2019d have to wait\nfor them to come on television.\nAnd if it was a Saturday\nand The Blob came on,\nit was like, \u201cGame on,\nwe are sitting through The Blob.\u201d\nI\u2019ve probably seen this film\nten times over the course of my life.\nSteve McQueen,\nof course, is in this film,\nwhich I\u2019m not sure\nif a lot of people are aware\nthat this is one of\nSteve McQueen\u2019s early films, but...\nOne of the most ridiculous films\nof all time.\nAlso like slightly scary,\nI think, when you\u2019re a young kid.\nThis notion that a blob\ncould appear and just...\ntake over everything.\n\u201cIncredibly unique\u201d\nis how I\u2019d describe The Blob.\nIf you haven\u2019t blobbed before,\nyou gotta blob.\nTelling you.\nAh, hello!\nYes.\nTerrence Malick, Badlands.\nI love this movie so much.\n1973.\nI think this may be my favorite\nTerrence Malick.\n[00:02:02]\nMartin Sheen and\nSissy Spacek.\nI mean, the beautiful performances\nin this...\nI had the absolute joy\nof working with Sissy Spacek\nsome years ago on a film.\nAnd I just hounded her\nlike crazy.\nShe\u2019s one of my acting heroes,\nand this is such a beautiful film.\nI think it\u2019s one of the great\nroad movies of all time.\nAnd one of the things that\nI most love about Badlands is\nI think it may be one of the best\ncar chases in cinema ever.\nAnd the reason I say that is\nI\u2019m a car guy.\nI\u2019ve raced... I, like...\nCars and bikes are my life.\nBut what Terrence Malick does\nin this car chase is\nhe doesn\u2019t overpower it\nwith stunt driving\nand vehicles that are\nobviously built to do it.\nIt looks like these cars\nare about to break every second\nand the cars are driven like\nthere are normal people\ndriving a car\nin a car chase.\nBut, yeah, just a great,\njust a great film,\n[00:03:00]\nsome great action\nand just beautiful.\nJust beautiful\nTerrence Malick.\nHere we go.\nOne of my favorite\nAustralian films.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen\nBreaker Morant,\nI thoroughly recommend it.\nBruce Beresford\ndirected this,\nand it has some really\nfantastic performances.\nBryan Brown, one of our\none of our most famous\nAustralian actors and living legend.\nIt\u2019s probably...\nIf it\u2019s not his greatest performance,\nit\u2019s right up there.\nBut this is...\nthis is a fantastic, fantastic film.\nThe Great Escape.\nThank you.\nIt epitomized so much about\nrugged performances.\nAnd the idea of someone needing\nto get out from where they are.\nJust a great, great film\nwith some amazing performances.\nGreat soundtrack.\nAnd the best motorcycle jump.\nYou know, you can do\nall your crazy modern-day stuff,\n[00:04:03]\nbut sometimes\njust a good old visceral\nman without a helmet,\nbit of grass, bit of razor wire,\nit works.\nKind of like\nthe Badlands thing for me.\nLike, it just always seemed real.\nI have found my last pick.\nWow.\nNight on Earth.\nI saw this at a time\nwhen I had no idea\nI\u2019d be an actor,\nor I wasn\u2019t in the business,\nand just being so blown away\nby this format,\nthis idea that you could have\nmultiple stories and...\nPerfectly executed.\nNight on Earth.\nJim Jarmusch.\nFantastic.\nIt\u2019s been so much fun.\nThank you, Criterion,\nfor having me.\nThis is...\nThis is awesome.\nI wish this Closet were,\nwere even bigger.\nBut this is part of\nwhat makes it so special.\nSo, thanks for having me today."}

Downs\nand I am honored\nto be in the Criterion Closet.\nI know I\u2019m not the first,\nI won\u2019t be the last,\nbut Election is\none of my all-time favorites.\nI think Alexander Payne is brilliant.\nThe tone is so specific and so good.\nAnd of course, Matthew Broderick and\nReese Witherspoon are so great in it, but\nthe supporting actors in this movie\nare incredible.\nChris Klein is so well cast for the part.\nAnd then one of my favorite scenes is\nhis younger sister\nalso campaigns to be class president\nand has an amazing speech.\nThat speech in the auditorium\nI could watch again and again and again.\nI guess I\u2026\nI know Tracy Flick\nis a villain, but I think\nI\u2019m a little bit of a Tracy Flick myself,\nso I do identify.\nBeing John Malkovich.\nAlso one of my favorite movies.\nI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just so creative.\nI\u2019m also\u2013 I\u2019m from New Jersey,\nso anything that has\nthe Jersey Turnpike in it, you know,\n[00:01:01]\nI\u2019m gonna love.\nThe melancholy of this movie\nis just really special.\nAnd I think it also really informed\nmy sense of storytelling\nbecause it was so out there.\nIt was one that\nI watched many, many times.\nAnd still could.\nMalkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich.\nAnd Charlie Kaufman, I mean,\nwe have to give props.\nSo this is Vanya on 42nd Street.\nThis movie is\nreally remarkable because,\nif you haven\u2019t seen it,\nbasically they shoot it\nin a dilapidated theater\nand it is, I think, one of the best\nportrayals of Chekhov\u2019s work\nbecause, as a realist,\nyou know, he wasn\u2019t\u2013\nit wasn\u2019t all about\ntheatrics and melodrama,\nand this movie is so interesting\nbecause it\u2019s really intimate\nand the camera follows\nthese actors around the space.\nJulianne Moore is in it,\nwho can do no wrong.\nAnd you know who\u2019s in it\nand is really brilliant in this movie?\nBrooke Smith,\n[00:02:00]\nwho, when I saw this movie,\nI think I had only seen her in\nSilence of the Lambs.\nYou know, \u201cput the lotion in the basket.\u201d\nAnd she was so good in that movie.\nBut she plays Sonya in this,\nand she plays it so beautifully.\nThere\u2019s one scene\nwhere she has a line about being so plain,\nand it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s so heartbreaking\nand she\u2019s so good.\nI gotta watch this again. It\u2019s been\na long time since I\u2019ve seen this.\nHow is this not on my list?\nThis\u2026 Tootsie is\u2026\nOkay, first of all,\nTeri Garr in this movie \u2013 there\u2019s a moment\nwhere she\u2019s at the table\nand Dustin Hoffman\nadmits what\u2019s been going on\nand she stands up and she goes,\n\u201cWhat are you doing to me?!\u201d\nIt\u2019s so funny.\nIt\u2019s one that I love also because,\neven though obviously\nthe premise of it seems insane:\nthis actor dresses as a woman\nto get a role,\nbut at the same time, it\u2019s all played\nin such a grounded way that\nit just really\u2026\nI think it\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s funny.\nIt\u2019s just\u2026\n[00:03:00]\nThis is an all-time great.\nI\u2019m going to\u2026\ngrab Traffic because Steven Soderbergh\nis one of my favorite directors.\nI think that he is\nso incredible.\nAnd you know what?\nHis style seems to me to change\nbased on the story he\u2019s telling.\nIt\u2019s not like he has one particular style,\none particular look.\nIt feels so inconspicuous to me,\neven though something like this\nis interesting because, in Traffic,\nit\u2019s the story of drugs\nand politics and sex,\nand we\u2019re seeing different storylines\nthat are differently color-graded\nto distinguish between them,\nwhich is so cool,\nand yet it doesn\u2019t feel\nham-fisted, it doesn\u2019t feel put on,\nit feels completely organic to the story.\nI know he also operates camera a lot.\nAnd I know he, like,\nedits dailies at the end of the day.\nAnd I think \u2013 I\u2019ve read this \u2013 that\nhe has cast and crew come in to watch,\nwhich I think is so interesting\nbecause some directors\nI think are really precious\n[00:04:00]\nabout that separation\nbetween the actor\u2019s work\nand then seeing what\u2019s on film,\nuntil it\u2019s completed.\nBut I think that\u2019s such a good thing\nto invite the actor to be a part of it.\nWe often say when we\u2019re making something,\n\u201cDo you want to watch playback?\nDo you want to watch this?\u201d\nBecause, at least for me as an actor,\nsometimes seeing it\nhelps me understand it.\nAnd also having read\nthe way that he responds to notes,\nbecause that\u2019s a big part of making films,\nand I think\nit\u2019s a really interesting thing\nwhen you\u2019re able to incorporate feedback\nand elevate the work, and I think\nSteven Soderbergh\nis someone who can do that.\nSo\u2026\nSomeone who\u2019s all about the story,\nlets that lead him and the audience.\nYou don\u2019t feel his hand too much.\nAnd that, I think,\nis part of the artistry of it."}

empress argue on\nthis but the Dexter Gordon performance\nand Bertram was smart enough to let\nDexter shape the performance\n[00:02:01]\num because he written one thing on paper\nand Dexter's kind of goes black people\ndon't talk like this Dexter how do they\ntalk let me show you and it works in\nperformance uh and Oscar win for the\nHarvey Hancock score oh\nto sleep with anger every Burnette film\nfeels has a sense of being lived in but\nnothing feels staged you can feel that\nintersection of American black life and\nItalian neorealism and also the nouvelle\nVOC I can't think of anyone who's more\nmasterly about that kind of thing about\nunobtrusive generous filmmaking than\nCharles Burnett here's a film that\nfinally exists on my own video\num you talk about a film that probably\nhas impacted as many filmmakers of color\nas any movie the last 40 years it would\nbe this one and\num\njust the chemistry between the two leads\nand the way music is used and maybe\nprobably when the first\nbig budget films that really bring the\n[00:03:02]\nsort of Slam poetry as a kind of\nemotional evocation the directory should\nhave surfaced again you can't help but\nsee this title and think what was in The\nEstablishment that kept him from working\num because clearly he had the stuff to\nmake many many movies and I'm hoping\nthere's a big one from him around the\ncorner my hands are shaking because I\nthink that Spirit of anxiety passes\nalong you're holding up the Parallax\nview I got the title in that time it's\nthe Piccola film that to me feels the\nleast studied uh you sort of feel a kind\nof control of the camera in a lot of his\nfilms and this one feels like he's\nreally trying to bring the filmmaking of\nsomeone like Fred Wiseman or or D.A\npennebaker a lot of the documentary\nfilming you want us to feel the anxiety\nin in each frame would you say Miller's\nCrossing wise would there be a um\na Criterion closet without a Cohen\nBrothers film in it I have a specific\nlove for this movie because as a Comics\nperson I always thought it was kind of\n[00:04:00]\nthe version of will Eisner the spirit\nthat if you did the spirit this would be\nit people who burns are being punched in\nthe head he wears his head low kind of\nhis eyes and at the end he\nturns out to be a little bit smarter\nthan almost everybody else except for\nMarcia Gay Harden there's a an action\nsequence in this a violin sequence\nactually that's almost like a musical\nnumber where a group of thugs think\nthey're going to take out Albert Finney\nand he puts his cigar down to dispatch\nthem at the end of the sequence he picks\nup his cigar and finishes it as some\nMichael those will Eisner in cigars I\ncan't recommend Miller's Crossing more\nhighly\nby the way when I asked him about that\nthey went\nwho was Will Eisner uh they had no idea\nwhat I was talking about and I said well\nit seems kind of Three Stooges oh yeah\nbecause he's getting dope slapped all\nthe time yes of course this seems like\nthe Three Stooges uh thank you all and\nenjoy your Criterion"}

We\u2019ve got\na great cinema called Close-Up,\nand I saw this a couple of years ago,\nand someone\nnext to me was eating, like,\ncrisps the whole way.\nAnd it really annoyed me because\nit\u2019s such a beautiful film about\nabout sex work\nand revenge and identity,\nand beautiful framing,\nreally elegant and thoughtful.\n[00:01:00]\nI haven\u2019t actually watched\nmuch else from this filmmaker,\nso I\u2019ll have to explore.\nThis is one that Martin Scorsese\u2019s\nWorld Cinema Project\u2026\nshone a light to it.\nAnd it\u2019s Lino Brocka,\nwho\u2019s an incredible Filipino filmmaker.\nMe and Dolly De Leon,\nwhen we did Triangle of Sadness,\nwould always speak about\nLino Brocka.\nOne of the first ones was\nManila in the Claws of Light,\nwhich is like an urban odyssey\nset in Manila\nin the \u201970s, I think.\nAlso Insiang, which is\nanother incredible one.\nAnd I believe that\u2026\nhe\u2019s someone who is,\nin the Philippines,\nhighly regarded as one of\nthe sort of masters of cinema.\nSo, I\u2019ll have that for myself.\nThank you very much.\nOh, yes. And of course,\nManila in the Claws of Light\non its own.\nWonderful.\nYeah.\nWhat a performance by the lead\nas well, I just want to say.\nThere\u2019s rarely real\nintimate close-ups,\nthey come later on in the film\nand it\u2019s so much more impactful.\n[00:02:00]\nBut he he has such\nan amazing angelic face,\nand he\u2019s going through\nsuch, like, tumultuous\ntimes in the film.\nYou watch him and you\u2019re just\nobsessed with\nstaying with him and his world.\nSo yeah, incredible film.\nAh, Gummo.\nI always loved Harmony Korine.\nGummo was one of those early films\nI watched that kind of\u2026\nwas disturbing, and it caused\ntrouble for film in a way.\nIt went against so much\nform, which I loved.\nAnd I met him recently\nand he was smoking a cigar\nand I thought,\n\u201cThat\u2019s very Harmony Korine.\u201d\nBut I used to skateboard\na lot as well, so I feel like\nskate culture and Harmony Korine\nkind of go hand in hand.\nOh, wow. To Die For.\nGus Van Sant and Nicole Kidman.\nMy favorite scene in this\nis when she\u2019s videoing\n[00:03:00]\nJoaquin and the other actors,\nand she\u2019s saying,\n\u201cMove your hips. Now let\u2019s dance.\nOh yeah. Come on, guys.\u201d\nAnd she\u2019s trying to get them to move.\nAnd Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s character\nis just, like,\ndoing this crazy, like,\nout-of-time jive.\nBut yeah,\nNicole\u2019s incredible in this.\nI love this film.\nIt\u2019s disturbing.\nJohn Mackenzie\u2019s Long Good Friday.\nWe actually studied this in school,\nthat end close-up on Bob Hoskins,\nand obviously an incredible\nHelen Mirren in this film, but\nI remember that was\nkind of the first time watching\ngangster cinema\nthat felt grounded and\nabout the human relationships\nrather than\nthe sort of glamorization\nof that lifestyle, you know,\nit was feeling deeply\nfor Bob\u2019s character,\neven at the end when he knows\nhe\u2019s kind of messed up, and he\u2019s\nalmost a bit pathetic, you know.\nThis is exciting.\nI\u2019ll do one last quick one,\nbecause I didn\u2019t talk about\u2026\n[00:04:03]\nI didn\u2019t talk about this.\nYi Yi.\nThere\u2019s some stills in this\nthat are just incredible.\nIf you look\u2013\nwell, watch it first of all.\nBut if you look at it after\non Film Grab or whatever,\nsome of the framing\nis impeccable, and\u2026\na quiet film,\nbut an incredibly nuanced film.\nYang is a master.\nGuys, I\u2019ve been greedy.\nI\u2019ve gotta go. This is bad.\nI\u2019m very grateful for this.\nThis is very cool.\nThank you so much."}

Rock\nHudson\nyou know the original trade all that\nhaven't allows Jane Wyman is a whole\nmood in this movie like this movie is\nbasically like How Stella Got Her Groove\nBack but with like white people in\nConnecticut rashimon this movie Just\ndoes a lot for me I'm very much into the\nidea of like reconciliation\nand conflict resolution and also the\nkind of fiction effect right how people\nremember things from their own\nsubjective points of view and I think\nthis is a movie that really\nmakes that come alive for me and I\nreturn to often when I write my movies\nespecially the inspection this movie\nplayed a lot had a lot to do with how\nmen spoke it's not necessarily a direct\nreference but it's something that I kept\n[00:02:01]\nclose to me while making the film\nnothing van peoples it's a box of his\nwork Melvin is one of the architects of\nwhat can be called Black American Cinema\nwe are all walking in his legacy sweet\nsweet backs badass song is one of the\nmost

Minstrel C is a part of\nthat agenda you know and I think\nProfessor Spike Lee who's my professor\nat Tish I think he really\num broke open a conversation\num and managed to help the whole world\nunderstand the the damage those images\ndid through this film and you know Damon\nWayans Miss Jada Pinkett Smith Tommy\nDavidson again another incredible\nincredible uh talented actor that

uh and she\ngot a chance to experience feminism you\nknow and she never did but she was a\nfeminist she was the first I think she\nwas the first woman to own a production\n[00:05:00]\ncompany in

don't want CG monsters I\ndon't care yeah old school Kaiju yeah\nonly if I get to be the Kaiju\nokay I just I just need to be the one to\ntalk about Tempo just because uh this is\na movie that like I feel like is very\nmuch like a\na reflection of my soul I love food I\nlove absurdity I love uh yeah I love the\n[00:03:00]\nway that it's like really sweet and also\nreally horrific sometimes the the\nsexuality in it is just bizarre and\nbeautiful and uh the uh one fun fact one\nof our Good Friends hero Mirai who's\nAnother music video director who now um\nAtlanta and stuff like that he's\nincredible uh his father\nwas the composer and he was also at the\nbeginning of the movie he's the guy\nwho's eating chips really loudly and\ngets beat up by the Yakuza so this place\nthat was when I first heard about it was\nlike hero posted online I was like maybe\nI'll watch that his dad scored it yeah\nno this is this is the best movie ever\nyeah it's amazing\num I I have like a I have a problem with\nmovies based on true stories like I feel\nlike it's like uh just scary you know\nlike bad journalism that like\nscreenwriters can just like nudge the\nfacts around but every once in a while a\nmovie breaks that for me you know I'm\nlike never mind this one's incredible\nyou know like love and mercy is one and\nMalcolm X is one this is just like such\n[00:04:01]\na riveting crime Saga like maybe my\nfavorite crime movie it just blew my\nmind when I first saw it uh like a year\nago and I also like am uh a pretty big\nSpike Lee fan as a writer director and a\nvery big Spike Lee fan as an actor he\njust comes in so hot in this movie and\nand do the right thing obviously uh but\nlike the opening scene is just him and\nuh and Denzel just walking through this\nlong Warner incredible crazy movie I\nwant to watch the special features oh we\ngotta we gotta do a little shout out for\num Jason Sparta\nso our production designer we've been\nworking with him for about 10 years this\nis his favorite movie of all time and uh\nevery year for his birthday he forces\nall of us to re-watch it and make\ndioramas inspired by the film and\nthere's like a diorama competition and\nhe he gives a winning prize out every\nyear and I think almost every single\nfilm or thing he's ever done he tries to\nsneak at least one prop that is inspired\nfrom this movie and so you know anyone\n[00:05:01]\nwho's seen the film knows that they have\nall these uh fake products or whatever\nin the background\num but they're like the laziest most\nbasic thing where the beer can will just\nsay beer and the cereal will just say\ncereal and he is in our movie the\nChapstick says chapstick oh yeah exactly\nI think so that's like the same kind of\nbranding that's a Repo Man chapstick um\nso anyways I'm gonna give this to him\nbecause I haven't oh you want to go okay\nI actually want to keep it okay I bet he\nalready has it I swear does he have\nCriterion I know we'll have to find out\nhe probably has every version yeah but\nyeah I've now seen it like five times\nbecause I was good at Jason's birthday\nparties and it gets better\nso now I'm just gonna go home go on your\nwebsite and buy more of these things\nbecause you guys deserve our money I\nwant you to stay in business thank you\nfor doing what you do everybody at home\nbuy their stuff uh Criterion is doing\nimportant work"}

{"id":"5qabOrVV3DQ","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qabOrVV3DQ","title":"Koji Yakusho\u2019s Closet Picks","subtitles":"[00:00:04]\nHello.\nWhen foreign films are screened in Japan, the\ntitles are often changed, which can make them\ndifficult to understand, but there\nis an amazing collection.\nLet's start with Japan. Ah,\nthis,\nthis, is amazing. It's Kusaara's\nAkahige Red Beetle. It's\na little long, over three hours, but it\n's a very beautiful film. It's really a\nwonderful story about a doctor who helps the poor. A\n[00:01:01]\nyoung doctor admires this doctor and\ngrows more and more as a doctor. It's a\nwonderful film. It's okay to put it in a bag.\nOk, this is crap, but Ikiru.\nYes, this is in Japanese.\n[Music]\nIkiru. When I was a child, my brother had\njust seen this movie, and he would tell me the\nstory of this movie while he was lying in bed. So when I\ngrew up, I\nwent to see the movie too, and the\nstory\nprogressed just as my brother had told me, and I was impressed\nthat my brother had remembered this story so well and watched it so well. Ah, this is\n[00:02:02]\nHarakiri. The Japanese title is Suppression.\nThis is a film by Kobayashi Tadashi, and the\nmain character, Nakadai Tatsuya, was my\nmentor when I became an actor.\nWithout him, I don't think I would be here today. The\nJapanese title is \"\nFuneral,\" but it's gone now,\nbut it was Ijuzo's directorial debut. It\nwas a wonderful film, really.\nThis scene of a funeral, something that every Japanese person has experienced, is\nportrayed with great humor. It's a true masterpiece. A\nwonderful film.\n[00:03:00]\nI'm in the ninth Japanese film masterpiece.\nIt's scary. It's a\ncreepy horror that touches on human psychology. You hear these strange noises throughout the film, which is\nreally scary. It's a scary story about how a\nstress-free state of being can make a person vulnerable to monsters. I\nalso recommend this film. I'm\nsure\neveryone will like it. In Japanese, it's\ncalled \"Machi no Hi.\"\nOf course, the lines in a film\nhave power,\nbut the power of showing something without words, just through pictures, is\nsomething that only a film can have. No matter\n[00:04:02]\nhow many times I watch it, I can't stop thinking about it.  I\nthink it's a wonderful movie. I\nrecently worked with this director on a\nfilm called Perfect Days. The\nfirst time I heard of this director was\nthrough the film Paris, Texas. It was so\ncool, with the open sky\nand the music. Oh, and by the way, the main character\nhardly spoke a word.\nI hardly spoke a word in Power Get Digital either.\nBut it\nwas a really beautiful movie. It\nwas a bit disappointing, but I recommend you all to see it. I\n[00:05:03]\nthink you'll probably like it. Please, please,\nplease see it. Thank you."}

{"id":"OQ0TJ1IkZIo","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ0TJ1IkZIo","title":"Alan Palomo's Closet Picks","subtitles":"[00:00:00]\nmy name is Alan Palomo otherwise known\nas Neon Indian and I'm here in the\nCriterion closet to pick a couple of uh\na couple of amazing films uh let's let's\ngo ahead and kick things off\nwow all right there's a there's your\nfirst setup right there so my first film\nis Alex Cox's Sid Nancy this one's\nincredible and of course like you know\nAlex must have been a punk you know you\nwatch Repo Man you see his influences\nthroughout his career uh so this is my\nfirst one uh my second is gonna be uh\nthis one here matres which I think is a\nreally incredible film by Barbie\nSchroeder the best way to describe this\nfilm is kind of like what happens when\nin uh Unstoppable Force meets an\nimmovable object like you have this\ndominatrix that through some bizarre uh\nlike home invasion situation starts\ndating\num this this giant ogre of a man uh and\n[00:01:02]\nit just sort of becomes about\num you know despite the fact that that\nhe has this physical prowess that she\nhas a psychological prowess so the\nfilm's always kind of posing the\nquestion like you know who's wearing the\npants in this relationship and uh\nwithout ruining the ending just to see\nwhere they're driving together at the\nend well it's insane it's just\ncompletely demented okay I I mean you've\ngot me uh you've got me stuck between\nwhether I want the DVD version uh or the\nBlu-ray version of fear and loathing Las\nVegas because this I think was the first\ncriteria on DVD that I got in high\nschool and I remember because it has the\nlittle removable uh outer part of it\nwhich I thought was just an incredible\nway to kind of showcase Ralph Steadman's\nwork without\num you know without putting the print\ndirectly just over it but uh you know\nwhat I'll pick the Blu-ray you might as\nwell uh live in the 2020s and embrace\nthe formats\num all right my next pick is going to be\nmedium cool because I haven't seen it\nbut I love Robert Forster uh he was\noften overlooked it always felt like he\n[00:02:00]\nwas in a lot of B movies uh obviously\nyou know Tarantino gave his career\nanother surge with uh with Jackie Brown\nbut I've always seen clips of this and\nit looks pretty incredible so let's\ncheck it out my next film is David Burns\ntrue stories I I grew up in Texas true\nstory there's very few films that really\ncapture kind of the the banality and and\nthe beauty of uh of rural Texas\nespecially in that time frame it kind of\nstrikes that same chord as something\nlike you know like when you watch King\nof the Hill and you're like well you\nkind of got to be there gotta be from\nthere to get the joke and this film\nreally does a phenomenal job of that\ntalk about a music movie\num you know this is this is an all-time\nfavorite uh jamush is Mystery Train I\ndon't know I have a strange connection\nto this film uh because I used to live\nin a college town that had a train that\nwould kind of pass through it uh in the\nmiddle of the night and I was dating\nsomebody at the time that was really\nobsessed with uh with blues music so\nthat would kind of be nodding off you\n[00:03:00]\nknow listening to skip James or\nsomething I would just kind of hear that\ntrain roaring in the background and I\nfeel like this film really kind of\ncaptures that that eeriness you know I\nlove that in the middle of the night you\nknow three people have the same\nencounter with this one song on the\nradio you know I I love it when people\nincorporate like radio uh as like\ndiegetic audio in a scene I think it's\ngreat so this one's going in the bag\nthis is another all-time fave\num this is a Felipe casals film called\nkanoa a shameful memory and it's\ninteresting because I remember I think I\nfirst saw it in um a Mexican horror film\nprogramming block and they included this\ndespite the fact that it's not\nSupernatural it's actually based on a\ntrue story basically uh you know this\nthis town that was controlled by this\npriest\num who convinced everybody that these\nthree backpacking students were actually\nsubversives from the city that were\nthere to protest and the three of them\nwound up basically being lynched and\nit's a really intense story that kind of\noccasionally breaks from The Narrative\n[00:04:01]\nto do this kind of like documentary\nstyle interview with the characters but\nit's really amazing the way that it kind\nof drums up tension yeah I could talk\nabout this all day I think my last pick\nwill be wings of Desire I remember I saw\nthis movie in high school and my dad had\nthis really beautiful comment about it\nwhere we were watching Peter Falk and\nthat's scene where he can't see the\nangel but he's talking to him and he's\nexplaining how like you know it's like\noh you don't know what it's like you\nknow you have a nice you have a cup of\ncoffee and you rub your hands for warmth\nsee and you smoke a cigarette and he's\nlike just basically explaining what it's\nlike to be a human uh and my dad I\nremember he just he just kind of he\nleaned back and he was like oh yeah\nis what it's all about you know and as\nsomebody that I wouldn't necessarily\nlike label as a cinephile like when a\nmovie is able to just convey a simple\nidea to someone and and it just connects\non this fundamental level\num I think it's done its job so uh I\nwant to thank Criterion for having me\n[00:05:01]\nhere today and uh I know what I'm going\nto be doing this weekend is plowing\nthrough all these movies I just took so\ntake it easy"}

the\nCriterion\ncloset every time I watch these videos\nI'm quite intimidated and I'm like God\nif I ever do that I'm probably going to\nbe so overwhelmed but it's like being in\none of those sensory deprivation pods\nwhere you're only surrounded by the most\nincredible Cinema ever made and I feel\nvery genuinely humbled to have been\ninvited here and I I'm going to not\nwaste any more time and I'm going to see\nwhat feels exciting to me the first\nthing that I come to is a a man that\nI've worked with called Terry Gilliam\nand this is one of his all-time great\nfilms Brazil and I adore it it's so\ninventive it's 1984 esque it's it's\ndystopian it's anti- capitalist it's\nanti-c commercialism it is uh a\nmasterpiece of rebellion and of insanity\nand Jonathan price has never been so\nincredible and Terry has never been so\n[00:01:00]\nlet off the leash I'm going to start\nthere this is so so fun I can't believe\nI get to be here gesi would be very\nupset with me if I don't grab one of his\nfavorite films of all time the red shoes\nthat he helped restore I believe and it\nwas him um that told me to to see it for\nthe first time and I did so there's a\nstory so I'm going to grab a couple of\ndocumentaries they're right here and the\nfirst one is a one of the is a maso's\ndocumentary called salesman that I um\nthat I watched as um on the advice of\nMike Nichols I can't believe I get to be\nin the criteria collection closet and\ntalk about the fact that I've work with\nTerry Gilliam Martin scy and Mike\nNichols in the first two minutes what\nhappened I do feel like this is a weird\nconfessional Booth this is like a\nconfessional booth and I'm having\nRevelation about how lucky I am in my\nlife like a visceral Revelation so we\ndid a a play Called Death of a Salesman\n[00:02:00]\nby Arthur Miller and um this was one of\nthe things that Mike said that we must\nwatch just to develop our souls as well\nas prepare us to make um that play you\nknow again the kind of the failure of\ncapitalism that we're currently living\nat the end of hopefully hope dreams\nanother great documentary one of the\ngreat documentaries of all time about\none of the great Sports basketball is\nmore important to me than most things in\nmy life and\nI think this what this film does so\npurely is it it gets in touch with our\nCollective human Longing To to make\nsomething meaningful out of this life it\nit it kind of makes it's a film about\nthe essential our essential needs as\nhuman beings to to be a part of\nsomething bigger than ourselves to to\ntry to follow the the image of a\ndream and um it just so happens to be\nset in the world of the most beautiful\nBaltic Soulful sport I [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] love this\n[00:03:02]\nfilm my favorite Mike Lee film one of my\nfavorite films of all time naked with\none of the Great Performances of all\ntime by David thulis and Mike Lee is\nsomeone who I just need to just bow to\nquickly because he's defined British\nfilm making for the last however many\ndecades and I just saw his most recent\nfilm he still got it I auditioned for\nhim once and it was a three-hour\naudition it was improvised three-hour\naudition where he just observed you\ncreating a character and living that\ncharacter\nhe's no one's doing it like Mike Lee oh\nKess another another one of our Great\nBritish\nfilmmakers Ken Loach and it's a humanist\nstory and it's tragic and it's beautiful\nand it's it's about it's about someone\nwho's been kind of deemed unworthy\nunnecessary\nuseless and disposable finding out that\nhe is anything but through his\nconnection to Nature through his\n[00:04:00]\nconnection to some a wild creature that\naccepts him as he is because he's a wild\ncreature himself it's an honoring of his\nown wildness and are all of our wildness\nand that we all belong kenlo is someone\nwho fights for people particularly the\npeople who have been deemed unworthy so\nFincher godamn this is one of his early\nfilms the game and it is so thrilling\nand it is so fun and you kind of go this\nprobably\nexists what Michael Douglas is being put\nthrough like Rich guys probably like can\naccess this kind of Adventure and Terror\nand Shawn pen it's just like I love this\nfilm I'll watch it like once a year the\nfilm making is so good it's so\nbeautifully constructed he's he he was a\nmaster from the beginning happiness I\nlove happiness so\nmuch I like mouth a gape it's a heavy\nfilm and with the late great one of the\ngreatest actors that have has ever\n[00:05:01]\nexisted Philip C Hoffman and I I really\nloved this I was young I was like 19 20\nwhen I saw this film and I was like\nfilms like this can be made and they can\nbe profound and they can have compassion\nfor people that we deem as monsters I\njust thought it was so funny and so\nweird and\nso you know you know what film can\ndo company the cast album one of the\ngreat documentaries one of the great\nfilms about the creative process The\nAgony and the Ecstasy it's so wild the\naccess that you have you feel like\nyou're there and it's it's all\nsuggestive there's no real narrative\nyou're just kind of with these artists\nthese like Thor breed artists who are\nstruggling to capture suim's impossibly\nincredible music da penaka who who's on\nthe on the um operating the camera is is\nRight In The Souls of these people it's\none of my favorite films of all time and\nthis\nis temp poo which which is my father's\n[00:06:00]\nfavorite film of all\ntime yeah um and I remember when we were\nkids me and my brother when we were kids\nhe would say so tonight are we going to\nwatch temp poo and me and my brother are\nlike 9 and 12 and we're like we don't\nwant to watch a Japanese ramen comedy\ndad and he was like a one day you'll\nwatch tppa and you'll appreciate it and\nabout 10 years ago in my early 30s I\nfinally bit the bullet and stopped\nresisting and I watched T poo and I\nrealized that my dad had incredible\ntaste and I think one of my favorite\nscenes in cinema history of an egg Yol\nbeing passed back and forth between two\nlovers I love this film and I love my\ndad and\nactually I have to thank my dad for my\npresence in this closet because my dad\nis a\ncopile and my dad introduced me to\nmovies his love of movies became my love\nof movies\n[00:07:00]\nand I just want to give a shout

It\u2019s...\nthat sort of weird space in between\nthat\u2019s really interesting to me.\nAnd then, you know,\nDennis Hopper, Easy Rider.\nI actually have this... an art book\nof all the photos\nthat Dennis Hopper took while\nmaking this film,\nand it is so beautiful.\n[00:01:01]\nI have it on my coffee table,\nand it inspires me\nto want to try to take more photos\nwhile I\u2019m making movies to...\ncapture something special.\nOh, okay. Take Out.\nI mean, this is, obviously,\none of Sean Baker\u2019s first films.\nAnd as I was getting to know him, he\nhe sent me a link to it\nbefore it was on Criterion.\nAnd it\u2019s fun to see sort of his...\none of his first interpretations\nof New York City, so...\ndefinitely going to take this one.\nThe Piano Teacher.\nIsabelle Huppert.\nMan.\nHas to be\u2013\nnot just in my eyes, but...\nworldwide, like, one of the\nmost incredible performances\nby an actress\nin, like, the history of cinema.\nShe is so intense and vulnerable, and\nthe scene where she,\nlike, stabs herself in the shoulder\n[00:02:01]\nwith the piece of glass,\nI think it is,\nthere\u2019s a sound that comes\nout of her throat.\nIt\u2019s so, like, guttural.\nI remember watching this\nand I was like, \u201cI have to...\njust, like, go back and\nsee this one more time,\nbecause I kind of can\u2019t believe that\nI just saw this performance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s like\u2013 and you imagine, like,\nwith another actress, would they...\nwhat would they have\nbrought to the character?\nBut you can only picture\nIsabelle Huppert in this role.\nI was attracted to the pink spine.\nBut Gilda, this is a classic film\nthat I haven\u2019t seen,\nbut I\u2019ve seen so many\nphotographs of, and...\nI mean, Rita Hayworth,\nobviously one of the\nmost iconic, sexy, talented\nactresses of that time, and...\nyeah, I mean this\u2013\nI need to see this.\nIt\u2019s kind of unbelievable\nthat I haven\u2019t yet.\nOkay.\n[00:03:00]\nAh!\nOh, Eyes Without a\u2013\nOkay, I was\u2013\nI was again attracted to the pink spine.\nBut Eyes Without a Face.\nI haven\u2019t seen this film\nin forever, but\nI think it has one of the most beautiful\nartistic movie posters of all time.\nAmazing. I need to one day\ndo a Halloween costume that\nis dedicated to this.\nOkay, The Kid.\nCharlie Chaplin.\nYou fall in love with this little boy,\nand he gives such a beautiful performance,\nobviously without speaking.\nAnd the chemistry\nthat they have together is\nis amazing, really.\nAnd I think, if I remember correctly...\nYeah, Jackie Coogan.\nA little bit sad, but that\u2019s why\nthe Coogan Account was created, which is\u2013\nI had when I was a teenager\ndoing a TV show, but,\nI guess, essentially his parents,\nbecause he was underage,\nhad taken his earnings\n[00:04:02]\nfrom all of the films\nhe did as a child actor,\nand he was left\nwith essentially nothing.\nAnd so the Coogan Account\nis put in place for\nyoung performers to have\ntheir money put into a separate\naccount that their parents,\nyour parents can\u2019t touch.\nI mean, it\u2019s due in part\nto his story, so.\nI want to find a title\nthat I haven\u2019t seen before,\nand I\u2019m looking through\nand there\u2019s so many movies\nthat are foreign to me.\nSomeone suggested closing my eyes\nand just, like, picking something.\nSo, I\u2019ll do that.\nHeaven\u2019s Gate.\nOkay.\nWyoming,\nfederal marshal\nand Isabelle Huppert\nand Christopher Walken\u2019s in this.

I was\u2026\nI was very young.\nI was probably about six years old.\nI saw it at the Grand Lake Theatre\nin Oakland, California,\nprojected on film.\nAnd this movie\nchanged my life.\nIn my opinion,\nSpike Lee has made two of the best\nfilm openings that I\u2019ve ever seen.\nOne of them is this one. The other one\nis Do the Right Thing, with Rosie Perez.\nThe way that so many people\nmeet Malcolm X is through audio,\nthrough recordings of his speeches.\nThat was how I\u2019d first hear him as a kid.\nAnd he juxtaposes it with\n[00:01:01]\nfootage of the\nassault of Rodney King by members\nof the Los Angeles Police Department.\nAnd he juxtaposes that with\nan American flag that\nburns into the shape of an X.\nAnd somehow that\u2019s not\nthe best part of the movie.\nYou know, it\u2019s just\nsuch an incredible movie.\nJust loaded with talent\nand incredible performances.\nThis film will live forever.\nSo I\u2019ma take this one home\nand add it to my personal collection.\nThis is love jones.\nIt\u2019s a perfect movie.\nI\u2019m a hopeless romantic,\nas you can see from some\nof these movies I\u2019m gonna grab.\nThe performances from\nLarenz Tate and Nia Long\nin this movie are exceptional.\nThe chemistry is off the charts.\nThe intricacy of it.\nThe film\u2019s got\nan incredible dynamic range,\nlike, of scenes of a lot of talking.\nThere\u2019s scenes with none.\nAnd shout out to the city of Chicago, man,\nwhich is gonna bring me to this other one.\nIt\u2019s also set in Chicago.\n[00:02:01]\nWhere are you?\nThis is Thief\nby Michael Mann.\nAnd I\u2019m going to grab another movie\u2026\nthat I think has to be\nin conversation with this.\nAll right, so this is Thief\nby the great Michael Mann.\nAnd this is Following\nby Christopher Nolan,\nwho\u2019s a mentor of mine.\nAnd I do think that,\nin observing Chris\u2019s movies, I think\nthat Michael Mann is a big influence.\nAnd you can feel it quite a bit\nwhen you look at this film.\nIf you haven\u2019t seen this movie,\nholy fucking shit, this movie.\nWhat I heard\u2013\nA rumor about this film is\nthis is the movie\nthat made wetdowns a thing.\nA wetdown, if y\u2019all don\u2019t know,\nis when you got enough money to\u2013\nI mean, this is probably, like,\na waste of water.\nBut when you got enough money\nto have a truck\nwet your streets down.\nAnd what it does is it makes the\u2026\n[00:03:00]\nfor nighttime photography,\nit makes the streets reflective.\nAnd the performance\nof the villain in this, and how\nthe performance is captured \u2013\nyou\u2019re slowly peeling back the onion\nabout how dangerous and how evil\nthis dude is.\nMichael Mann just did a brilliant job.\nWhich takes me to this.\nThis is my guy.\nI\u2019ve come to know him,\nI\u2019ve come to know his wife.\nAmazing people. First and foremost,\nthey\u2019re just lovers of cinema\nand lovers of family.\nThe world is richer\nbecause they\u2019re making movies.\nAnd it\u2019s just brilliant because\nit\u2019s obviously the most indie\nyou\u2019ll ever see\u2026\nMr. Nolan, he finding his way.\nA lot of the Christopher Nolan\ntrademarks are here in this movie.\nSo it\u2019s great, if you coming up,\nto get a little taste of this.\nWhen I was coming up as a young man,\nthere were two filmmakers that\nwere making movies at the same time,\nthat were in conversation with each other.\n[00:04:00]\nThat was Spike Lee and that was\nJohn Singleton, rest in peace.\nBoth of those filmmakers\nmean the world to me,\nas an American filmmaker,\nas an African-American filmmaker.\nAnd their movies taught me things.\nSome time ago, the same thing\nwas happening in the country of Japan.\nYou have\nAkira Kurosawa\nand you have another gentleman\nnamed Yasujiro Ozu\nthat were\nepic filmmakers,\nmaking films at the same time.\nAnd making very different types of films.\nMuch has been said about this film.\nWhat I think he was the greatest at,\nin terms of things I\u2019ve learned\nfrom watching his films,\nis the art of blocking.\nThe other thing he\u2019s great at is\npoetic fallacy.\nChoosing when to use wind and rain\nis just insane.\nOzu.\nOzu is a filmmaker who\u2026\n[00:05:00]\nHe didn\u2019t give a shit about\na lot of rules. Most importantly,\na rule we spent a lot of time learning\nabout, which is the 180-degree line.\nThis is an imaginary line\nbetween conversations.\nBecause film is a two-dimensional,\nvisual art form,\nif you move the camera\nacross this imaginary line,\nwhat will happen in the editorial process\nis it will look like characters\nare looking in different directions,\nwhich can sometimes be confusing or\ncan put an audience in a state of unease.\nOzu didn\u2019t give a fuck about the line.\nHe would jump it all the time.\nHe also was very famous\nfor shooting doorways.\nBut what I\u2019m going to talk to you about\nwith Ozu right now, in this movie,\nis his capacity for\nthe most emotional endings\nyou\u2019ll ever see in your life.\nHolding your hand throughout a story\nand making you fall in love\nwith characters\nand then just ripping your heart out\nat the end of the movie\nin a way that oftentimes\nleaves you sobbing.\n[00:06:01]\nBut also in a way that makes you\nquestion everything that you saw before.\nLate Spring is a great example of this.\nLate Spring was the first Ozu movie\nI ever saw.\nI saw it before I had children,\nobviously, I was in my twenties.\nAnd it\u2019s a story about\na father and a daughter at its heart.\nWatching this movie,\nalong with making\nmy first film, Fruitvale Station,\nmade me realize\nthat I wanted to be a father.\nThis is Devil in a Blue Dress\nby a hometown hero, Carl Franklin.\nSo, this movie\u2019s a masterpiece.\nMassive influence\non my latest picture, Sinners.\nBut it\u2019s a Great Migration movie.\nIt\u2019s about Los Angeles, but\nthe characters are all from Houston.\nAnd it\u2019s just beautiful, man.\nIt\u2019s a Walter Mosley adaptation.\nYou know, my admiration for this film\nhas only deepened.\nBut it\u2019s just an incredible\u2026\npiece of cinema,\nand an incredible film noir.\nLove &amp; Basketball\nby the great Gina Prince-Bythewood.\n[00:07:02]\nSo look,\nme and my producing partner and wife,\nZinzi Coogler,\nwe both met as athletes.\nWe met on a track field.\nAnd\u2026\nyeah, this movie is about two athletes\nfalling in love with each other,\ndipping in and out of each other\u2019s lives\nin their pursuit of athletic greatness.\nI can\u2019t look at this movie and not see us.\nI can\u2019t look at this movie\nand not think about where I was\nwhen I first saw it. I was in high school.\nIt just leans into the romance\u2013\nI love the ending of this movie,\nthe ending of this movie\njust puts a lump in your throat.\nWho\u2019s watching who\nand what professional\u2013\nI mean, look,\nthis is\u2026\nThis is the one.\nYou know what I\u2019m saying?\nThis is going in the bag.\nThank you all for the\u2026\nfor the Blu-rays and 4Ks\nand all of that good stuff.\nI\u2019ma enjoy this.

the closet and I'm going to\nchoose a 10 films I haven't seen them\nlike I haven't even looked around so but\nI I immediately he on this angle to the\nleft is perhaps the first one I have to\nto choose which\nis Amores Perros and I love this this uh\nthis poster I am going to say State the\nabsolute obvious of why I think this\nfilm is the first one that came to my\nattention and and that I choose because\nuh this is how films started for me and\nit was many of us our first experience\nAlejandro's first experience I think it\nwas Rodrigo prto the cinematographer it\nwas like his third movie or something H\nThe Producers it was their first movie\nit was many of us it was our our first\nmovie so peros of course absolutely I'm\ngoing to look for one that it was also a\nvery\nfundamental sort of big beginning of uh\n[00:01:01]\nme watching films H because I know that\nCriterion has it uh it's called uh\nmemori okay cool here it is yes okay wow\nso this is Memoirs of under development\nthis for me is the the most important\nfilm in Latin America it is an\nincredibly modern story that uh that uh\nlike all good things it had many\ninterpretations a great introspection on\non on the the the soul of of the Cuban\nRevolution on the people that left on\nthe people that stayed and uh and it is\na incredibly sophisticated intelligent\nkind of take on on on humanity and also\non our sort of belief system it's a\nreally great movie so yes H let's skip\nto some something that is not from my\n[00:02:02]\nyou know my my postal code that is a\nlittle bit further away ah this one of\ncourse of course okay blow up I love the\nthe films that have a character that is\nthe the worst person to solve a crime or\nsolve a situation you know like this is\na photographer that that just discovers\nsomething and um and goes into a whole\nkind of an adventure that also is quite\nquite meaningless as well I think\nnowadays if we look at it it's like uh\nwe can see how much free time we had\nwhen we were before we had telephones\nand Instagram and those kind of things\nyou know and before it we people would\nwonder and run into situations okay uh\npurple noon uh this film it was it was\nperhaps the first time that I captured\nthis wonderful Essence that many uh\nThrillers from France\n[00:03:00]\nhave that uh they don't explain too much\nthe psychology or the psychoanalysis\nbehind why the characters do what they\ndo or why the you know the bad guys are\nthe bad guys or what you know and and\nbecause if you compare that to what\nhappens in the United States is like\nit's all about you know having a\njustification for what they do and uh I\nlove that the French don't do that we\ndon't acquire more attention by\nunderstanding oh it's because you know\ntheir parents treat them badly and uh\nthis is why like that doesn't life\ndoesn't work like that also no Cinema\ndoesn't but life even less so it's uh\nyeah this film is is fantastic I\nrecommend it a lot and Al Landon is very\nbeautiful in this one very very very\ngorgeous this one of\ncourse andama and your mother also I'm\nglad that they never change the title\ninto English because do it's not doesn't\nsound so good okay why why I think it's\n[00:04:02]\nso I'm so glad that it's in this\ncollection is because uh normally you\nknow when when the film came out it was\nuh sort of seen as a teen comedy you\nknow like kind of like ah you know you\nknow teens but obviously it is not it's\na very deep film and there's two things\nthat I think this movie has that\nnowadays very few films have one is the\nfreedom that it was that it exudes you\nknow it's a it's a film that it was done\nwith absolute\nfreedom I think I discovered Cinema like\nproperly you know how to make Cinema\nhere with Alonso guon who included Us in\nthe making of this but the other thing\nthat is very important is I want you to\ntell me which uh film has made you horny\nin the last\nyears there's not many actually there is\nnone and I miss that from Cinema because\nI used to get you know I used to learn\n[00:05:01]\nabout stuff when I was a kid watching\nfilms and now it's like you know like\nyou don't walk out of the cinema feeling\nlike something and this one does this\none does when you come out of the cinema\nwatching this you just want to live and\nand and have sex and and\nuh and enjoy and love people and uh so\nyeah of course yes and I was it just\nappeared okay the L Vel collection the\nstuff he threw out the the dramaturgy\nthe the craziness the the you know just\nthe concepts that he was talking about\nit's so so sophisticated and modern and\nyet with a lot of humor and uh and a lot\nof intelligence as well you know and so\nthis this collection has a theet charm\nof the bouri theia which is perhaps one\nof the best titles ever I never got to\nknow bu of course course I was very\n[00:06:01]\nyoung when when he passed away and um\nand but I got to know really well\nER Jean CLA ker and uh the screenwriter\nof of these films but also the\nscreenwriter of uh many others and he\nwas such a mentor and and uh such a\nwonderful person that um we could spend\nnights um doing this is that he knows a\nlot of the I mean he must have known\nover a 100 coridos from the revolution\nin Mexico and nobody would expect that H\nbecause he spoke many languages and he\nwas like in interested in many many\nthings but through the\ncoridos and the way he sang them it was\namazing and I don't know if there's a\nthere's a record of of him singing them\nbecause he also has such a great deep\nvoice you know and he would sing them in\nsuch a beautiful way so I I miss him and\n[00:07:00]\num and I I think he uh the the things he\ntold me about Cinema and uh and and you\nknow the support as well and supporting\nme as a director also with the stuff\nI've done and and hopefully the stuff I\nwill do he was really really helpful and\nand really encouraging so uh I mean such\na genius this is how it ends with Lis W\nthe best director by far I mean\nyeah\ngracias"}

Sullivan\u2019s Travels.\nSo I was never, like,\nan old movie fan when I was a kid.\nMy film-loving\u2026\nperspective really came from\nThe Godfather and\nDog Day Afternoon,\nPanic in Needle Park.\nYou know, those screwy \u201970s\u2026\nThe French Connection.\nThose are the kind of movies\nthat I cut my teeth on.\nNot as an actor, but as a filmgoer.\nBut then, probably deep into my 20s,\nI started looking at old movies and\ndiscovered the movies of Preston Sturges,\n[00:03:02]\nwho I think is such\nan interesting director.\nAnd this one is:\nJoel McCrea\u2019s a director,\nand I do like movies,\nalthough they don\u2019t always do well,\nabout the movie business\nwhere they have a tongue-in-cheek\nand interesting point of view\nabout this crazy job that we have.\nSo he\u2019s someone that wants\nto do the ultimate sort of\u2026\napproach his movie-making in a Method way,\nand have a kind of\nlong-range ride-along,\nso he goes across\nthe country exploring that.\nAnd this is a great, fun, hilarious\nlook at that and social comment.\nOkay, yeah,\nso this is The Fugitive Kind.\nDirected by Sidney Lumet,\nwho\u2019s one of my favorite directors,\nand written by\u2026\nI don\u2019t know if Tennessee Williams\nwrote the screenplay\nor it was based on\nTennessee Williams\u2019s play,\nwhich was called Orpheus Descending.\nAnd I guess that studio\ndecided that Orpheus Descending\nwas a little too highbrow a title.\nThis is the first\nMarlon Brando movie that I saw,\n[00:04:02]\nbefore On the Waterfront\nand Streetcar Named Desire,\nor obviously The Godfather, Apocalypse.\nAnd I was so struck with\nthe turn in acting\nand this kind of acting,\nthis kind of like\nsuper naturalistic, edgy,\ndangerous kind of thing.\nAnd he just was a master of that.\nAll you got to do is look at that cover.\nThere he is in that snakeskin jacket and,\nyou know, it\u2019s just\u2026\nIt\u2019s great. I haven\u2019t seen it in\na long time, so I\u2019m looking forward to it.\nFor my last pick,\nI am going to close my eyes\nand do a random pick.\nHere we go.\nJules and Jim.\nJules et Jim.\nNow\u2026\nThis is funny.\nThere\u2019s two little\u2026\nanimals that come around\nour house every summer,\nand I\u2019ve named them Jules and Jim."}

you know black and\nwhite like if you look on amazon now\ni was like looking up um just just for\nmorbid curiosity looking on amazon\nreviews of films is a\nterrible idea and i remember reading\nsomebody's\nlike three word review that just said ew\nblack and white you know and i was like\nreally but then i was like wait i think\ni actually might have felt like that\nwhen i was a kid

this very small closet\nafter watching it on YouTube many many\ntimes and see all these movies this is\nthe actuality dramas of alen King the\none I've seen as a married couple which\nis one of the most stunning\ndocumentaries I've ever seen in my life\nit's I think it's\n1969 1969 and you're watching a\ncouple basically get divorced and it's\nan era where there is no real television\nand people don't really understand what\nit means to have a camera crew with them\nall the time and so they let the camera\nthey forget the cameras there from an\nacting standpoint getting to like watch\nthese events happen with people in a\ndocumentary it is the bar like a great\nperformance is a bar but a higher bar is\nwhat do real people look like when\neverything's melting down around them M\nCowboy to me is sort of like the Mona\nLisa like M Cowboy is the most beautiful\n[00:01:00]\nmovie from a cinematic standpoint John\nslesinger and it's somebody who's not\nfrom New York coming to the New York of\n1968 or 69 and like filming it in its\nmost sort of absurd weird dirty version\nof itself and then inside of it are\nthese like really extreme characters but\nfilled completely with such great\nperformances from John voy and Dustin\nHoffman um who are bring so much emotion\nand depth to something that could\notherwise be sort of like a fascin like\na novelty piece about these weird guys\nand all their or almost like making\nfun of them I feel like the version of\nthis now would almost have like more of\na satirical slant to it and it's a\nmiracle of a movie and was rated X and\nis important and is really great and I\nlove it a lot I kind of want a bunch of\nmovies that I just haven't seen which\nare not interesting to talk about like\nthe before Trilogy I I've never actually\n[00:02:01]\nseen that's where they walk and they\ntalk and they like each other a lot\nright oh dest Rides Again it's Jimmy\nStewart who's like probably my favorite\nactor and marlina AD Dietrich and that\nalone if you know what like their\nenergies are is a weird enough\ncombination that it just makes the whole\nmovie so wild and there's these great\nfight scenes with marlina Diedrich and I\nforget who the other actors is like\nbrawls but Jimmy Stewart's just the most\nbeautiful person on screen and there's\nthis like heart and um uh fear and rage\nand just kind of everything and and and\nso this is like a western that's a old\nHollywood studio system Western but has\njust a weird other energy to it that I\ncan't really describe but it feels like\nthere's something just really unique and\nspecial about it okay um his girl Friday\nCarrie Grant and Roslin Russell\npre\n[00:03:00]\nstanislavskian acting taking over movies\npre- Brando movie one thing I think\nabout with this movie is the power of\nhaving actors who are that good with\nreally kind of stage acting um in the\nsense that they're able to sustain takes\nfor 10 minutes and stay on um and actors\nwith that level of of craft but who uh\nwho are still very real inside of that\nand have to do you know crazy crazy\ntechnical things and pull the Hat down\nand then throw the cigarette over to the\nother side of the room and say the line\nright at the same time and it's just um\nmagnificent and you know I think that\nhaving really good actors in your movie\nis really important because then you can\ncut differently\nY where be y here we go y Edward Yang\nhis uh eye for these little moments with\nchildren or families or turning points\nin people's lives or sor\n[00:04:00]\num it's not just beautiful things it's\nalso the sad things that people go\nthrough it's all shown in this really\ngorgeous way almost a little like wings\nof Desire where it feels almost like\nsomebody is outside of life or there's\nlike uh an angel or something watching\nlife itself and all of its um I want to\nsay enumerations but I think that's\nprobably the wrong word so all its\ndifferent\ncolors I'm here so I'll do\nthis I said to you before I think\neveryone probably does this but it's\nworth it uh John\ncetti's I was 15 I went to the AO\ntheater in Santa Monica which is a\nspectacular food theater that I saw a\nlot of first films at and saw woman\nunder the influence and then I kept\ncoming back to it and it there is there\nis a reason that he is you know sort of\nthe load star for so many people now\nthere is an imperfection to it there is\na wildness to it a a sort of refusal to\n[00:05:02]\nbe anything other than\nhis his himself at the edge of who he is\nat the on pushing the envelope of\neverything he had in him and putting it\ninto all of these films and defying both\nexternal and internal hesitation or\nguard rails against you know him being\nanything other than his full of self I\nwish that More film artists were as\nFearless\nbasically um my final pick is life and\ndeath of Colonel blimp this movie is so\nbeautiful and pans spans over this big\nperiod of time almost related to Yi in\nthe sense that it you really feel the\nspan of these people's lives over time\nand there's something really beautiful\nabout that effect because you know my\nfavorite movies which e and this and\nit's a wonderful life do is that you\nwalk out of the movie and it's not just\nhow I like that movie it's that you have\na better you you want a Savor and\nappreciate life you have more deeply and\n[00:06:01]\nthat's to me like the power of of all\nthese things at their best is that you\nleave you know looking through different\neyes a little\nbit"}

I don\u2019t remember properly.\n[00:01:00]\nThat\u2019s why my English\nis taking so long to come.\nBut I was in Japan,\nand there\u2019s a bar in Golden Gai,\nin an area of tiny bars,\none next to the other,\nand one bar is called La Jet\u00e9e\nbecause of this film,\nbecause of the Chris Marker film.\nWell, Chris Marker\u2019s work is amazing.\nWhatever you see with his name,\nget it, watch it, pay attention.\nBut I love the idea that in Japan\nthere\u2019s a bar called La Jet\u00e9e,\nthat is someone from Japan\nin love with cinema,\nand a beautiful place\nto go and have a drink.\nI\u2019m telling this whole story\nbecause this time I was in Golden Gai\nand I couldn\u2019t find the bar.\nAnd I don\u2019t know if,\nbecause of Covid, it closed.\nIf you find it for me,\nmake sure you send me the address for it\nnext time I\u2019m in Japan,\n[00:02:01]\nif you know something about the bar,\nif it changed, if it moved.\nAnd if it didn\u2019t, then\nI just told you a story about\na beautiful bar you\u2019ll never know.\nOh, crap!\nI wasn\u2019t looking for this one.\nY tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n.\nAwww.\nProbably the most special\nproject I\u2019ve ever worked on.\nBefore Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\nI was just doing projects in Mexico.\nMy whole idea was just to stay there,\ndo more theater than cinema.\nAnd then this film changed\nmy perspective in many, many ways.\nI met one of\nthe most interesting directors\nI\u2019ve ever worked with, which is Alfonso.\nAnd the special community we made here,\nwith everyone, everyone.\nIt\u2019s like this is\u2026\nThis is family for me.\nBut I am not going to take it\nbecause I have, like,\nfour of these at home\nand I\u2019m going to let someone else take it.\n[00:03:01]\nI recommend,\nnext time you come to the Closet,\nstart here.\nAnyway, I was going somewhere else.\nI\u2019m going to take Carlos.\nI\u2019ll tell you why.\nBut now that I\u2019m here,\nI\u2019m also going to take\u2026\nI was talking about\nJuliette Binoche last night,\nand I was saying that\nfor a long time she was a referent.\nAnd I was talking about these films.\nI was talking about\nhow important was Blue in my life,\nhow important was Kie\u015blowski.\nNot just for these, but the Dekalog,\nand just the integrity\nof someone, as a filmmaker.\nI mean, there\u2019s obviously many,\nmany great referents here,\nbut this one came right\u2026\nin the right moment in my life.\nI was 14, 15 years old,\nand Kie\u015blowski was crucial for me.\n[00:04:03]\nAnd Carlos,\nI think it\u2019s one of the first\nbeautiful examples of\nlong-format storytelling\nthat now we\u2019re using so much\nwith the miniseries.\nAnd I think it\u2019s beautiful for actors.\nThis long format allows you to go\nvery deep into portraying a character,\nto bring many layers to your performance.\nAnd long-format is\u2026\nI mean, I\u2019m enjoying long-format.\nAnd this one was the first time\u2013\nAnd I remember there was like,\n\u201cOh, but he\u2019s a film\u2013 It\u2019s not a film.\u201d\nAnd who cares?

I have\nn't seen it yet, but a\nfriend recommended it to me, saying, \"Do you know any good films about Paris?\"\nSo, this is, \"Yes, definitely,\n[00:01:00]\nhatred, Chinese\nhatred, Tony, a genre Tony,\nthis is something I haven't seen on DVD very often,\nand then there's Cl\u00e9doy's Bottle\nby, a beautiful work, and this is also really, really,\nDonny, the dance at the end is really good, but to be\nhonest, I haven't seen it yet, but Bin\nBader, director Athens Ozawa, the master of the world.  I have\nn't actually seen the version that's over four hours long, so I'll take this opportunity to watch it.\nJohn Wallace 5 Fuss, for me, John\nWallace is really the most important soccer player,\nand to be honest, I have it,\nbut I'll take it as a souvenir.\n[00:02:02]\nYes, Lubitsch Heaven Kiwi, heaven\nawaits, I haven't seen this in a long time,\nand I want to see the 4K restored version. I\nhave the impression that the color was really beautiful, so I definitely want to see it. Floating\nWeeds, this was also\ntaken in Oz's Diary, but it's different from the usual one.\nMiyagawa, who is also famous as Mizoguchi's cameraman, collaborated\nwith Miyagawa Kazumichi, and I'm very\nsorry, but I'll take this one too. Oh,\nJack\nDomi's\nBox, Laura, Irie the Angel,\nAga from Sible, are really his masterpieces, and they're\nall wonderful, but I'll\ntake this Jack\n[00:03:02]\nthat's included. George Franzisco, and the\nscene with the bird mask is very  I ca\nn't quite forget, but there was a time when I couldn't see\nGeorge Francis at all, so I'm\nreally grateful that I can see him now.\nThank you very much.\nOh, Nicholas Ray Bigg Sam Knife, I\nreally love James Mason's\nCrazy Mountain, so I'll\ntake it.\nWell, I saw Marco Brocki's Fist\nin the Pocket a long time ago,\nbut all I remember is that there was a scene where a man was sitting on something on a desk.\nMarco Brocki\nis still amazing, so I'll take it. I still have it,\n[00:04:01]\nand actually, I also had the bonus, and the\ninterview with\nPusa Sensei, the director, Cure, was also there,\nand I also have Madan John Ko, and that's\nHenry Fong from Bloodline of the Wilderness, so I'll take this too.\nThank you very much."}

So,\nBob Fosse, All That Jazz.\nSo I just watched this again\nquite recently, actually.\nIt\u2019s a work of\nabsolute genius, in my opinion.\nAnd if you want to look at where a lot\nof modern editing gets its ideas from,\njust look at the sequences of him\ntaking the pills,\nwhich are spread throughout it.\nI think that\u2019s a great movie.\nGreat, great, great,\ngreat, great, great movie.\nSo this is one I am taking home.\nSo they\u2019ve got Anora,\nwhich\u2026\nTo my shame,\nI hadn\u2019t seen his other movies.\nAnd I went immediately\nafter watching Anora,\nwhich I thought was just wonderful,\nand I went back to Florida Project,\nwhich is even more remarkable in a way.\nAnd I\u2019d missed it the first time around.\nSo apologies, Sean Baker, and chapeau.\n[00:01:00]\nThey\u2019ve got one of his other films here,\nwhich I am going to take,\nThe Prince of Broadway,\nwhich I knew about, but I haven\u2019t seen.\nSo I\u2019ll be taking both those,\nplease, if I may.\nSo I have to give a shout-out to\na great and very, very underrated\nBritish director,\nStephen Frears.\nReally one of our great craftsmen.\nAnd this is a film he made\nwith John Cusack, Anjelica Huston,\nand Annette Bening:\nThe Grifters.\nI think it\u2019s based on a Jim Thompson\nnovel or short story, and\u2026\nwho\u2019s a great writer.\nIncredible.\nThis, you\u2019ve got to see this film\nfor three sterling performances.\nYou watch Annette Bening and you think,\n\u201cOh my goodness me, what an actor.\u201d\nYeah, I was looking\u2026\nI was looking for Fish Tank.\nAnd there it is.\nYes. Oh, here we go.\nSo this is a British filmmaker,\nAndrea Arnold.\nIf you don\u2019t know her,\nyou should see her work.\nTrue independent. Brilliant filmmaker.\nThis is a wonderful film that she made.\n[00:02:01]\nMichael Fassbender\u2019s in it,\nand it\u2019s partly about Essex,\nwhich is an area of the UK.\nAnd it has the most extraordinary\nskies. You cannot believe the\u2026\nThey\u2019re so beautiful\nand it\u2019s shot by Robbie Ryan,\nwho I think shot\nher new movie, Bird, as well.\nThe casting that she does,\nthe way she finds actors\u2026\nremarkable.\nYeah, wonderful film\nand a wonderful filmmaker.\nSo there is a theory that\u2026\nwhich I\u2019m happy to say\nthat this is absolute proof of,\nthat your first film\nis always your best film.\nAnd my first film, which is also available\non the Criterion Collection,\nwas called Shallow Grave, and it\u2026\nMy dad always used to say\u2026\nI used to take my dad to all my films,\nand he\u2019d say the same thing every time\nwhen he came out of them.\nDidn\u2019t matter what it was,\nwhether it\u2019d won Oscars or whatever,\nhe said, \u201cOh yeah, it was good, son,\nbut it wasn\u2019t as good as Shallow Grave.\u201d\nSo he believed the theory that\nyour first film is always your best film.\n[00:03:00]\nTo say that the Coen brothers have\nnever made a better movie than this\nis not an insult. It is an extraordinary\u2026\nIt just shows you the talent that\u2019s there,\nand you can see them\nlearning their craft as they make it.\nSo if you want to watch\nwhere it all began,\nthen this is the one to start with:\nBlood Simple.\nOh my goodness me.\nSo,\nI was talking earlier about\nShallow Grave, the first film, and\none of the buzzes when you do films\nand you kind of like\u2026\nyou get invited to exotic places.\nAnd we got invited to\nCuba,\nto the Havana Film Festival.\nAnd it was an incredible experience\nto be in Cuba.\nAnd two of the films that we saw\nwhile we were there\nwas this:\nI Am Cuba, which is a staple\nand is recommended,\nand everybody should see it really.\nBut\nthis film\nis\nthe film with the worst title, I think,\nprobably imaginable.\n[00:04:00]\nIt\u2019s called Memories of Underdevelopment,\nand it\u2019s a film by Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea.\nWhat can I tell you about this film?\nWhen I saw this film,\nwe were working on Trainspotting,\nso we\u2019d released Shallow Grave\nand we were working on Trainspotting,\nand I can\u2019t remember whether we\u2019d\u2026\nI think we\u2019d shot\u2026\nNo, we hadn\u2019t shot it.\nWe were working on it,\nand we didn\u2019t have an ending.\nAnd I saw this film,\nand I stole,\nframe by frame,\nthe last shot of this film\nfor the last shot of Trainspotting.\nAnd if you happen to watch this movie,\nwhich is available on Criterion\nand is available on an extraordinary,\nproper regrade of this,\nyou\u2019ll see the last shot of this film\nas it was intended to do,\nas it reflected\nthe last shot of this film.\nAnd you\u2019ll realize how\nthe phrase,\n\u201cWe stand on the shoulder of giants,\u201d\nis\nhighly appropriate.

it's in here it's got to be\npretty good so this one is like this\nholds like a really special place in my\nheart this is Philadelphia Story um I\ngrew up we were a Katherine heer house\ndown um when I was growing up and this\nis one of my favorites I think like two\nlike I was so I was such the little kid\nthat like if the movie was in black and\nwhite I was like no thank you I it was\nreally hard to convince me to watch a\nblack and white movie because I was you\nknow a '90s kid like that but um\nPhiladelphia Story felt relevant to me\nat 9 years old and I think that's like\nsort of the beautiful like timelessness\nof this story and the performances\nspecifically The Big Chill this is the\nkind of movie that I want to make big\nEnsemble uh relationship drama\n[00:01:00]\nthe reunion of it all and these\ncharacters and the history that they\nhave and the story that it weaves\nthrough that history is um so fun to\nwatch unfold and I think like if I ever\nmake something that's even as close to\nuh this good I would be uh I would die a\nhappy man for sure this one is um I\nguess kind of newer to the Criterion\ncloset and one that I was a little\nsurprised to see in here this is the\nothers um one of my all-time favorite\nhorror movies um and this holds a really\nspecial place in my heart because this\nwas the movie that I first um held a\ngirl's hand during um because she was\nscared I was scared but yeah it was like\nmy first Middle School girlfriend Kelsey\nuh named redacted like I probably\nremember that moment more than I\nremember anything else about the movie\num but truly an incredible movie and\nlike the coolest like twist endings I\nthink for horror movies you you kind of\nsee it coming now if it were made today\n[00:02:00]\nbut back when I was 13 it really blew my\nmind sound of metal um such an\nincredible recent movie I think I mean\nit obviously got some awards love in\nterms of nominations and stuff like that\nbut I still feel like a lot of people\nmissed this when it when it first was\nreleased such an incredible uh\nperformance from Riz Amed and um he also\nI mean and this is this is maybe not the\npoint of being in here but he's so hot\nin this movie so hot like I dyed my hair\nblonde and people thought it was because\nI was having a gay midlife crisis but in\nfact it was because of the sound of\nmetal okay now it's time I don't even\nknow if this is going to fit in my bag\nbut um this Godzilla sort of uh 15 Kaiju\nClassics um now if you only have time\nfor one I'm definitely going to say um\nMathra versus Godzilla is my favorite\nout of this uh crop I grew up on these\nmovies like we would get them and like\nwear them out from Blockbuster video uh\n[00:03:00]\nRP and I Mathra was my favorite uh of\nthese films I don't know exactly why I\nthink there was like something I don't\nknow like gentler about Mathra I think\nlike Mathra is um forgive me gay coded\nuh and I think I sensed that as a little\nboy and I just I I love it um couldn't\nstop in the closet without uh talking a\nlittle bit about won car y um In the\nMood for Love is such a uh\none of his best I think it's an\nincredible movie I I will say this is\nkind of a placeholder for me for Happy\nTogether which they are giving me on the\nway out Happy Together specifically if I\ncan talk about that really quickly is I\nthink the first movie I ever saw that\ndepicted um love between two Asian men\nand it was such a powerful um movie for\nme to see uh at that point in my life\nbecause I I just never seen that on film\nbefore and it and like I feel like we do\n[00:04:00]\nget lost in the sauce a little bit when\nwe talk about representation and what it\nmeans and and how important it is and\nall those things today but I for me like\nwhen I think about how powerful it can\nbe to see yourself represented on screen\nlike that movie comes to mind\nimmediately for me because it it\ndefinitely um seeing yourself reflected\nin that way when you're not used to it\nit can it it's it's a real Paradigm\nshifting moment for uh or it can be for\na lot of people and it was for me um so\nso um In the Mood for Love certainly but\nif you have time check out uh Happy\nTogether as well please this is\nincredible I did I I thought I would\nreally struggle but I'm I'm having such\na good time and finding um so many good\nones like this I just looked up and this\nis what I found hewick and the angry\nEdge John Cameron Mitchell um one of my\nuh all-time favorite filmmakers and\nsomebody that I definitely draw a huge\namount of inspiration from and uh I had\nthe honor of being his husband in the\n[00:05:00]\nHulu show shrill which was such a full\ncircle moment for me as an actor and as\na writer just like being that close in\nproximity

I have also\n[00:02:01]\nperformed it in the theatre and this\nperformance by Paul Chiesa of\nMacbeth is truly general.\nFinally, Umberto D is another masterpiece,\nas is not always the case, but sometimes it\nhappens. A very tragic film, certainly\nnot cheerful, which has not been very popular with the\npublic, but as is always the case with\ncertain masterpieces, it\nstands the test of time and I believe that perhaps it will not\nbe eternal, but it will last for a\nfew more centuries, I don't know, but it is certainly for a few\ndecades. These are all films that I\nwould fervently recommend\nyoung people to see because they are milestones of\ncinema."}

Underappreciated.\nI think the film, just overall,\nunderappreciated.\nOkay, Memories of Murder, Bong Joon Ho.\nThis is strangely difficult to find.\nAnd so part of the reason\nI\u2019m drawing it here\nis so I always have access to it.\nPhysical media is important.\nAnd really everything\nBong Joon Ho does is brilliant.\nSo, can\u2019t go wrong there.\nSpike Lee, Bamboozled.\nSaw this movie\nbefore I worked in Hollywood.\nLoved it.\nTerrified me.\nHaving worked in Hollywood\nfor more than 20 years,\nit\u2019s scary\nhow accurate and prescient it is.\nIf you want to work in Hollywood,\neverybody should see this movie\nbefore doing so.\n[00:01:01]\nAlso annoyingly hard to to find, so\nget the DVD.\n4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days.\nAlso topical.\nI\u2019m not going to say anything more\nabout the film,\nother than that it\u2019s brilliant\nand everyone should see it,\nespecially in this country today.\nTootsie, Sydney Pollack.\nI had the great pleasure\nof working for Sydney Pollack\nin the last year of his life.\nA legendary filmmaker with legendary\u2026\njust a record of brilliant films.\nAnd also just a really good man, so\nRIP Sydney, RIP Teri Garr.\nYeah, Tootsie.\nI know absolutely nothing\nabout this box set, but\none of my holy grail projects\nis a Paul Robeson biopic.\nAnd if I can\u2019t make it,\nsomebody else should.\nSo I\u2019m taking this,\nmainly so I can ask everybody on Earth\nto seriously consider figuring out\na Paul Robeson biopic\n[00:02:02]\nor, more likely, a limited series\nbecause his life is so incredible\nover so many different eras\nand so long-term impactful\nthat someone should figure it out.\nIf it\u2019s not me, that\u2019s fine.\nThen I can watch it\nwithout having to make it.\nVery, very excited about this.\nOh, featuring essays by Hilton Als,\nCharles Burnett, and Paul Robeson.\nSo great reading\nin addition to film stuff.\nAnatomy of a Fall, Justine Triet.\nIt won the Oscar for a reason.\nIf you haven\u2019t watched it, do.\nIt\u2019s just a\u2026\nI\u2019m just very excited\nto see what she does next.\nAnd Sandra H\u00fcller is\njust an incredible actress.\nJust doesn\u2019t miss a moment.\nThere\u2019s an oblique 50 Cent reference,\nwhich you don\u2019t really get\nin French cinema on a yearly basis.\nLast but definitely not least,\nAlice Diop\u2019s Saint Omer,\none of the great new, exciting\nfilmmakers on this planet.\nAnytime she does anything,\nI\u2019m excited for it.\nThis is another underappreciated classic,\nwhich I guess is the theme here.\n[00:03:02]\nSo watch this movie.\nBut also watch anything\nthat Alice does because\nexciting new voice.\nNot even new anymore,\nbut exciting voice period.\nShe\u2019s got a lot to say about the world\nand we all should listen."}

It\u2019s really beautiful.\nTarkovsky really knows\nwhat the fuck he\u2019s doing.\nOkay.\nI\u2019m gay!\nSo here\u2019s the thing about being gay,\nsometimes it gets sad.\nAnd I watched All of Us Strangers\nprobably not at the best time.\nI think the dopamine level in my brain\nwas, like, subzero.\nAnd I did one of those things\nwhere you cry so much it gets\n[00:01:02]\ngross-slash-\u201cShould I go to the ER?\u201d\nI was like\u2026\nYou know, call me basic. I know I\u2019m\u2026\nI\u2019m on the Paul Mescal bandwagon.\nI\u2019m on it. I\u2019m on that hayride.\nAnd Andrew Scott is devastating.\nIt\u2019s a really beautiful, poignant\nkind of ghost story.\nDoesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense.\nDoesn\u2019t matter.\nBut it\u2019s just so beautiful, and you just\u2026\nWhen Paul\u2019s at the door with the whiskey,\njust like, \u201cLet him inside. Let him in!\u201d\nBut he doesn\u2019t.\nAnyways.\nDon\u2019t look at my butt. Okay.\nSo.\nBelle de jour\u2019s a fabulous movie.\nI love one of Luis Bu\u00f1uel\u2019s other movies:\nLe Charme discret de la bourgeoisie\nor The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.\nBut this is great.\nSo, Catherine Deneuve, so hot,\nshe plays a bored housewife\nwho becomes a hooker.\nSo many little things\nfrom this movie stick out, like\nthere\u2019s a guy at the brothel\nwho tries to pay with, like,\n[00:02:02]\ncoupons or something.\nAnd I\u2019ll never forget, the madam is like,\n\u201cNon, \u00e7a ne marche pas ici. De l\u2019argent!\u201d\nAnd I always just say that in my mind:\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t work here. Give me money.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some fun BDSM\nkind of fantasy stuff.\nAnd she\u2019s just so\u2026\nShe\u2019s just so gorgeous.\nCatherine Deneuve. Okay.\nThen let\u2019s see what else we got here.\nPina.\nThe thing about Pina Bausch\nis that her dance theater\ntroupe was kind of like\u2026\nkind of like a cult, but in a good way.\nIt\u2019s a group of people\nthat were so intensely\ncommitted to a singular vision from her,\nwho was revolutionary.\nShe\u2019s really, really, really\nchanged the whole game\nin terms of dance and dance theater.\nI got to see two of her pieces\nin Brooklyn Academy of Music\nbefore she passed away,\nso I\u2019m really glad about that.\nLong pieces. Two and a half hours.\nHard for Gen Z.\nNow, anybody who loves film\nknows that if there\u2019s\na really, really difficult problem\n[00:03:01]\nthat you have to solve\nor an obstacle\nthat you have to get through,\ncross-dressing is the number one\nmost effective way to do that.\nI\u2019ve found that in my life to be true\nand so has Dustin Hoffman\nin this classic, Tootsie.\nDustin Hoffman plays a struggling actor\nwho can\u2019t get a gig, so he tries\nto get a gig on a soap opera\nplaying this woman.\nHe goes in drag and of course he gets it.\nAnd there\u2019s even\u2013\nOne of the older cast members,\nwho\u2019s kind of a pervert,\nfalls in love with her.\nAnd it\u2019s this like\u2026\nDid everybody have glaucoma?\nIt\u2019s, like, crazy\nbut it\u2019s just so well done.\nAnd Teri Garr.\nTootsie.\nAnd here we go.\nHappiness, Todd Solondz.\nThis is probably the most fucked-up movie\nyou\u2019ll ever see in your life.\nI\u2019m so happy that Criterion has it\nbecause I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere.\nIt\u2019s not just a black comedy.\nThis is like a rotten black comedy.\nIt\u2019s people at their worst,\nat their dazzlingly worst.\nAnd it\u2019s just like an accumulation of\n[00:04:02]\nhuman shit piling up on top\u2026\nIt\u2019s just so fabulous.\nPolyester, John Waters.\nOh my God, look at that.\nLook at that cover.\nRomance.\nFrancine Fishpaw.\nTab Hunter.\n(Gay.)\nAnd then\u2026\nIt\u2019s got a whole bunch of stuff.\nI think this was the one\nwhere the daughter\ngets in trouble for dancing at school.\nThe mom says,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t dance at school, do you?\u201d\nShe\u2019s like, \u201cFor a quarter I will!\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s just so funny.\nIt\u2019s just so great.\nFucking A.\nSo Polyester. The classic.\nAnd I\u2019m going to boost this one because,\nlike I said before,\nI do happen to be extremely gay.\nViciously so here in New York.\nQuerelle.\nOr \u201cQuerally.\u201d\nWhat a pleasure.\nThank you guys so much for having me.\nThis is so lovely.\nOh, Double Indemnity.\n[00:05:01]\nThat is also the name of a very good porn.\nBut I doubt that\u2019s what that is."}

closet and I'm excited\nabout it but also a bit nervous because\nwhen I'm watching films I'm getting so\ninvolved in it that it's um that I'm\nafter watching a film I'm usually very\nexhausted and very often I just I forget\nit it's like um a great kiss if you have\na very long kiss with somebody\nafterwards you don't know what happened\nduring the kiss you just remember it was\nwonderful and so uh I often just\nremember like little Snippets for\nexample here I see three women from\nAlman and I remember I absolutely loved\nthat film but the only thing I really\nremember was that there um was the dress\nof the one woman I think of sh Deval it\nwas always um uh caught in the car in\nthe door of the car car and that is all\n[00:01:00]\nthat I remember about this woman so I\ntake that definitely I haven't seen it\nin a very long time oh and right next to\nit is inma bman scenes of a\nmarriage fantastic film and I have to\nsay igmar Burgman is my greatest\nprofessional\nregret because I met igar Burgman in\nMunich he saw me in the theater and he\nwanted to do a theater play with me and\npossibly a film and and I turned him\ndown I I don't know why to this day I\nthink I was influenced by the man I was\nliving with at the time he discouraged\nme I think he was afraid I might fall in\nlove with him but Liv Ol Man is just one\nof the greatest actresses ever oh here\nis the leopard I was doing a film with\nuh chimino the Sicilian and so that's\nwhy I watch the leopard and chimino had\n[00:02:00]\nthis weird idea actually great idea that\nall the actors in the film they had to\nsocialize with the people um that they\nwere playing so I remember Josh akland\nhad to go in some remote Village in\nSicily and uh socialized with the mafia\nand I played an aristocrat and I\nsocialized with the aristocrats in\nSicily and so the leopard was wonderful\nto watch for\nthat uh yeah I take that and visonte is\nof course visually everything is so so\nbeautiful oh\nhusbands I love that film it was for me\na whole new kind of film when I saw that\nfor the first time in fact I used to\nshow that to my students because I was\nteaching acting for a short time uh at a\nconservatory in Germany I think our film\n[00:03:01]\nacting in the 70s was still very much\ninfluenced by theater and this was so\nnew this\nimprovising and um a bit gritty and I\nreally love that and I wanted my\nstudents to see that and I one day I\nwhen I came one of the first times to\nNew York was in\n84 um I heard that cavus was\num rehearsing and a friend of mine here\nin New York said you can count I can\nsneak into the theater and so I snuck\nmyself into the theater and was sitting\nat the very end somewhere trying to hide\nand I watched the rehearsal and I was\nreally was very excited and then they\nhad a break and all of a sudden Ben\ngazara and kavus kind of moved in the\ndirection where I was sitting and I was\nsaying oh God oh God now they're going\nto discovering me and they're going to\nsay something why I'm here and then uh\ncasava said hi Barbara and I thought\nwhat and they asked me if I wanted to\n[00:04:00]\nhave lunch with them and then I had\nlunch with them and he was like I\nimagined he would be very personal with\nthe actors very um you know gave them a\nlot of space um I I I like the way he\nworked and uh he said at the end he\nwould like to work with me but um I\nthink then he passed you know Mike Lee\nnaked that was also an experience that\nwas very new for me to see that kind of\nacting that that kind of um going really\nto the edge and uh I met him later\nbecause I was with him in the jury in\nBerlin he was the president of the jury\nin the film festival and\nuh I I heard and I was talking to him\nthat he did these very very long\nrehearsals which was the opposite of\nFender with whom I worked and I see that\nthere's thein Alexander Platz that is\nwhen I met fender for the first time and\nyeah\n[00:05:00]\nhe had this thing that he did only ever\none take there was a situation that I\nremember I had a scene with hanashi Gula\nand we were um in a\ncar and uh they had to rig the camera on\nthe car so he couldn't be with us and so\nwe did the scene without him I think we\nwere sitting in the car reading a letter\nlaughing something like that and uh so\nthen the scene was done and he asked us\nuh so how was it and we said\nyeah and he said you want to have\nanother take and we were what another\ntake we never have the chance to do\nanother take so we said yeah of course\nwe did another take and then we came\nback and then he said so which one do we\nprint so we had to decide it was a way\nof working that I loved um but very\ndifferent I think probably the opposite\nof Mike\nLee last Strada Fender told me to\nwatch before we did B in Alexander Platz\n[00:06:02]\nand I think he wanted me to see Joetta\nmazina and maybe\nher cles\num way of acting that is something that\nhe thought had something to do with the\nrole that I was then playing in\nAlexander Platz what I love is the\nSimplicity of this film The Simplicity\nof the story The I you don't need any\nspecial effect you don't need any

I hope.\nWinchester \u201973,\nthe first film that Anthony Mann\nmade with James Stewart.\nMaybe an unconscious adaptation\nof The Forged Coupon by Tolstoy,\nwhere you follow\na coupon from one character to another.\nThis has Rock Hudson\nas a Native American tribal leader,\nwhich some characters in Eddington\nwould not appreciate.\nParallax View,\none of the three\nPakula masterpieces from the \u201970s.\nOne of my favorite conspiracy thrillers.\nThis has one of the best sequences ever,\nwhich is the brainwashing,\nsubliminal-messaging video.\n[00:01:03]\nJust incredible editing,\nand funny and scary,\nand a great ending.\nLacombe, Lucien, one of the great films\nby the great Louis Malle,\nabout a young man\nwho wants to join the Resistance\nagainst the Nazis.\nBut when the Resistance doesn\u2019t take him,\nhe decides to become a Nazi.\nAnd, I mean, Nazis are\nback in the mainstream.\nSo, yeah, it\u2019s worth a watch.\nRevanche.\nAustrian film with a French title,\nby G\u00f6tz Spielmann.\nI don\u2019t hear it being talked about\nnearly enough.\nIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful films.\nThe composition\u2026\nEvery shot is just gorgeous.\nAnd it\u2019s a great film about\nisolated people and coincidence.\nAnd it\u2019s beautiful.\nI love it. I really love it.\nPeckinpah is a filmmaker\nthat\u2019s always on my mind,\nbut especially with Eddington,\nand Straw Dogs\nis a perfect film,\none of the great films about,\n[00:02:02]\nyou know, just how awful it is to be\na person living with other people.\nAnd it\u2019s also\none of the tightest films ever made.\nIt begins in a fraught place and just\u2026\nit\u2019s a snare that just tightens\nand tightens and tightens until\nthe climax,\nwhich is just one of the greatest\nin all of movies.\nAce in the Hole by Billy Wilder,\nthe first truly reviled movie\nthat he ever released.\nAnd it\u2019s a really misanthropic comedy that\nis genuinely upsetting, genuinely funny.\nHonest\nin its anger\nin a way that a lot of films\nmade in America in the \u201950s\nweren\u2019t allowed to be.\nAnd it lands its point\nwithout compromising.\nIt\u2019s a great film.\nHere\u2019s another reviled film,\nA Face in the Crowd.\nThis is one of the great\npolitical satires,\nwith one of the great villains,\nLonesome Rhodes, played by Andy Griffith.\n[00:03:01]\nIf I could have cast Andy Griffith\nin Eddington, I would have.\nAlso the way that\nhe\u2019s brought down in this movie\nis the same way\nthat the Penguin\nis brought down in Batman Returns.\nWanda by Barbara Loden.\nI know this movie\nhas received its due reappraisal,\nbut not enough people\ntalk about how funny it is.\nThe character of Mr. Dennis,\nplayed by Michael Higgins, is\u2026\nis right up there\nwith Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet.\n\u201cNo junk.\u201d\nHe\u2019s talking about pickles.\nIt also has one of the great\nfinal freeze-frames,\nwhich involves a hot dog.\nDo the Right Thing, Spike Lee,\none of the most seminal texts\non race in America.\nPlayful, funny,\ninventive,\nsad, scary.\nIt\u2019s a huge film.\nAnd for anybody who\nattempts to talk about race in America,\nthis is always there.\nGraduation,\none of the great films\nby the great Cristian Mungiu,\n[00:04:01]\nabout a middle-aged white guy\nliving in a quasi-rural area\nwho is trapped in\na maze of crises of his own making.\nJust going to mention The Grifters,\nbecause you cannot make a crime film\nwithout thinking about Jim Thompson.\nThis is a great film.\nYou guys also put out Coup de torchon,\nwhich is Tavernier\u2019s\nadaptation of Pop. 1280.\nThis is great.\nYou Can Count on Me, Kenneth Lonergan,\none of the great small-town movies,\none of the great films about siblings.\nNobody writes dialogue,\nnobody writes people as well as he does.\nAnd that includes his plays.\nMargaret should end up in here as well.\nThe Wages of Fear,\na great slow burn\nwhere the movie takes its time\nintroducing you to its characters,\nsetting up the environment,\nsetting up the dynamics,\nso that when the action hits,\nit is very affecting\nand frightening\nand upsetting.\nYeah, this is a masterpiece.\n[00:05:00]\nLone Star by John Sayles.\nGreat film about\nall these cultural identities having to\ncohabitate and live together,\nand about American history.\nIt\u2019s investigating American history.\nJust a really sensitive, smart\nAmerican epic.\nLast Picture Show by Peter Bogdanovich,\nbased on the great book by Larry McMurtry.\nReally specifically observed\nand very funny.\nAnd it\u2019s a film that I come back to a lot.\nI find it very comforting.\nIt also has such a\u2026\nlike, a wonderful texture.\nBogdanovich made some great films,\nbut this to me is the greatest.\nBut that brings me\nto another Bogdanovich film,\nTargets.\nOnce you\u2019ve seen Eddington,\nyou will understand\nwhere these are connected.\nMaybe the best film\nmade under Roger Corman.\nBogdanovich also acts in the movie,\nand it\u2019s not his best performance.\nThat would be\nThe Sopranos.\nYoung Mr. Lincoln,\nMy Darling Clementine,\ntwo of my favorite John Ford films,\ntwo of his most romantic films,\n[00:06:00]\nfilms about the heroic myth of America,\nthe dream of America.\nAnd it\u2019s very sad that they\u2019re\u2026\nthat they\u2019re not true.\nHopefully they will come to pass.\nNo Country for Old Men, Coen brothers.\nAnybody making a contemporary western\nhas to contend with this one.\nWe all know it\u2019s perfect.\nI have nothing to add.\nWell, it\u2019s always nice to be back in here.\nThank you for letting me in.\nHopefully you\u2019ll have me again.\nThank you."}

the camera's on sticks it's\nabout three feet off the ground and a 50\nmillimeter lens\nand he just lets it stay and lets the\n[00:01:00]\ncharacters work the frame\nand what happens is that he

it\ndefies your ability to replicate it this\nis Martin scorsese's World Cinema\nproject which has several films on it\nseveral that I don't know but the one\nthat I do know and that the reason why\nI'm getting it because I I don't know\nhow to get it otherwise it's pishote one\nof the sub themes of it is the kind of\nevolution of a criminal which I explored\nin my thesis film at the AFI and you\n[00:03:01]\nknow some of what I saw in the movie and\nwhat from my own experiences or actually\nwhat I what I you know kind of saw\naround me uh in the area that I grew up\nin which was a rough

don't\nyou have no idea why you know what were\nthe elements that came together that\nbrought him there you know you know\nsometimes it's uh can be some very\nserious crime and the thing about the\nkid who plays the lead\nit deals with you know one of the one of\nthe things that it deals with is how the\nauthorities respond to these children\nwho are committing crimes in Brazil and\nthe the

an\nactor and uh I'm with ICM talent and um\nI'm GNA just talk about some movies that\nI like\ntoday so yeah I guess I'll start with\ngood morning because this one kind\nof made a big impression on me and it\nwas I think the first oou movie I have\never seen and I've seen a few of them\nsince then and um it sort of deals with\nall the familiar themes that he deals\nwith mostly uh concerning parent\nchildren dynamic DCS and um shifting\nDynamics and generational gaps and um\nhave you seen this movie actually yeah\nso there's a lot of fart humor in this\nmovie actually which was unexpected and\nuh you know the kid shits his pants and\nall that and it's it's really cute and\num it's such a simple story actually I\nthink he made this movie in as a silent\nfilm first called I was born but which\nuh is another really special movie and I\nhad a very special experience watching\nthat movie with a friend\n[00:01:00]\nthat I hadn't seen in years and um\nactually now our friendship has taken\nroot again since we saw that movie\ntogether so he's a powerful\nfilmmaker and uh it's a pretty simple\nstory of the kids want a television set\nto watch sumo wrestling and stuff and um\nthe parents don't want to buy the\ntelevision set it's sort of like you\nknow industrialization in the future and\num like the Western World creeping in in\nthis postwar Japan and the parents are\nagainst it but they realize that they uh\nthey can't win that battle and the kids\ntake a vow of silence against them to\nget their ways and and they win and it's\njust a beautiful film and um I really\nlove Japanese films which is something I\nlearned about myself a few years ago and\nso I wanted to put that one in my uh\ncollection just to because it's like the\nfirst thing that got me started down\nthat road I\nguess um yeah so the other movie uh\nthat's really special to me that I\nwanted to mention is closeup and uh I\n[00:02:00]\nguess probably\num it's a it's a very widely appreciated\nfilm but I think some people don't know\nit and I actually got some friends of\nmine to watch it one night some friends\nof mine asked me for a film\nrecommendation I said watch close-up\nlike there's no way you won't have a\ngreat time and they were like no we did\nkind of like was in the right\nVibe but um anyway it's an incredible\nfilm and uh it's like the most\nincredible use of real\npeople reenacting something that really\nhappened to\nthem you can't believe\nthat what you're watching is not real\nthat it's a reenactment he he used the\nreal people who were in these\nsituations to create the feeling of\nthose situations again and it's it\nreally feels like you're there in this\nin these moments and um it's just full\nof magic and I don't know I guess it's\nprobably him and his most powerful\ncurist St me with this film that and\nwhere's my friend's house which is it's\n[00:03:00]\njust\nbeautiful um yeah and it's a very sad\nfilm too about you know film love and\nwanting to be someone that you're not\nand wanting to kind of disappear and you\nknow things that we all deal with on a\ndaily basis I\nguess\nso there's that one and then yeah this\nAllen King\ncollection um I'm Canadian so I thought\nI should put a uh Canadian in there and\nI wanted to just find a collect that it\nmatched my shirt\nperfectly that's odd\nactually but anyway yeah this whole\ncollection is incredible and um we were\ntalking about come on children which is\na really great film with great music too\nArlo Guthrie music and uh Warrendale is\nalso a great one but the one that really\nreally got me is a married couple which\nis so funny and so heartbreaking at the\nsame time but I mean that the language\n[00:04:01]\nof this couple is incredibly comical and\nfeels written almost the way they're\ntalking you know the the husband is so\nkind of\nsardonic and at the same time you're\nwatching this real thing which is this\nuh marriage\ndisintegrating in Fr in front of a\ncamera and maybe partly because of the\ncamera you kind of get a sense that\nthey're like not able to hide anymore\nfrom their\nproblems and yeah it's sort of like a\nreal life um\nscenes from a marriage in a way kind of\nfeels like that you're watching them try\nand fail at uh putting the pieces back\ntogether it's really great great\ncollection yeah those were the ones I\nwas going to pick and then I also kind\nof wanted to just mention Tootsie since\nI saw it in here and uh didn't realize\nthat it was coming out on Criterion and\nthat's a great\nfilm this is like kind of a\nspecial thing this movie that there's\nthis\n[00:05:00]\nincredible powerful director Sydney\nPollock making this kind of seemingly\nlight comedy but doing it in this really\nintelligent way and a friend of mine\ntold me a Sydney pollet quote that\nis a film a good film should be two\nsides of a good argument and uh I think\nthis\nmovie is a good example of that you\nknow and of course Bill Murray's like\nincredible in this and Jessica Lang's\nbeautiful\nand uh Dustin Hoffman's also\nbeautiful and um straight time is\nanother great movie but might not come\nout on Criterion but um another good\nmovie Dustin Hoffman performance that\neveryone should\nsee so\nokay that's that's me call me we can\ntalk more about\nit great that was great okay thanks so\nmuch thanks man"}

I lived there for all of 2024\nto study the language\nfor my second book that I\u2019m working on.\nAnd to completely immerse myself\nin the language,\nI decided that I was only going to consume\ncontent that was in the Korean language.\nSo I only listened to Korean music\nand I only watched Korean films.\nAnd there\u2019s something there called\nthe Grand Bell, which is like their\u2026\nI don\u2019t know, Cannes or their Oscars.\n[00:03:02]\nAnd so I wanted to watch all of the films\nthat had won Best Picture\nin the Grand Bell\nand learn a lot more about Korean cinema,\nwhich is so fantastic.\nAnd I\u2019m surprised\nI never got around to watching it,\nbut this movie called The Housemaid\nby Kim Ki-young.\nYeah, it\u2019s pretty much any one of\nyour favorite South Korean directors,\nthey probably will have said that\nthey were influenced by this film\nbecause it\u2019s very famously\none of the greatest\nSouth Korean films of all time.\nAnd it\u2019s a part of this Martin Scorsese\nWorld Cinema Project box set,\nwhich seems to have\na bunch of really fantastic films\nthat I\u2019m sure are all really great.\nAnd so, yeah, I\u2019m excited to finally watch\nKim Ki-young\u2019s The Housemaid.\nThis is my final pick.\nIt\u2019s The Spirit of the Beehive,\nwhich is both a great\nband and film.\nThis young, six-year-old actress,\nthat, yeah, has these eyes\nthat looks like it\u2019s seen\n[00:04:00]\nmaybe 40 different lifetimes.\nThey just have such great depth.\nAnd her performance is stunning.\nIt\u2019s a beautiful, haunting film,\nand I can\u2019t wait to revisit it\nbecause I remember loving it so much.\nAnd yeah, I\u2019m excited\nto add it to my collection."}

Sorry.\nI started watching Hitchcock\nwhen I was a child,\nand I\u2019ve always been really\nmesmerized by his psychology.\nIt\u2019s very, very strong, very erotic.\nAnd it\u2019s actually weird as a kid\nthat I was so into it.\nThis is fantastic.\nTo Be or Not to Be, Lubitsch.\nA must-see, and re-see\nand re-see and re-see forever.\nIt\u2019s absolutely wonderful.\nI think what I like about\nthese kind of movies is that...\nI mean, \u201cthese kind of movies,\u201d\nit\u2019s a bit banal to say,\nbecause it\u2019s one in a kind,\nso it\u2019s not a kind of movie, but...\nis the idea to bring\nsomething very politic,\nbut, underneath,\ncomedy.\n[00:01:00]\nActually I saw something that goes\nin the direction of what I just said.\nYeah, right.\nVery nice cover.\nDivorce Italian Style\nis a very different story\nfrom Lubitsch.\nBut what made me\nthink of it is that\nDivorce Italian Style is a comedy.\nIt\u2019s really, really funny.\nWhen I was a kid and I first saw it,\nto me, it was just a comedy.\nAnd then growing up\nand learning about Italian politics\nand how divorce has been legal in Italy,\nI think in 1974,\nwhich is really, like, late.\nAnd that\u2019s when\nI understood that\nDivorce Italian Style\nwas a very political film\nin the sense that it\u2019s a guy\nwho wants to get rid of his wife\ninstead of divorcing,\nbecause he cannot divorce.\nAnd so if he kills her,\nhe only gets three years of jail.\nYou know, that\u2019s what they used\nto call passionate crimes.\nSo that was a part of\u2013\nhow do you say?\u2013 patriarchy.\nSo it is good it has changed\nfor the better.\nI mean, there\u2019s still\nsome work to do, but...\n[00:02:01]\nSo anyway, so Divorce Italian Style\nis a very political film\ndisguised into a comedy.\nBack to basics. Mean Streets.\nJust...\nNo comment, just perfect.\nI love Scorsese,\nany Scorsese I love.\nI love his films.\nI love the man.\nKiyoshi Kurosawa.\nCure, I want to see it.\nJapanese horror, very good.\nI like horror movies.\nAnd when I was a child, once again,\nI saw many of them because my mother\nwas crazy about vampire stories\nand my stepmom had\nno knowledge of what\nkids should see or not see.\nSo thanks to that...\nignorance, I was able to see\nso many horror movies.\nI don\u2019t know what it is\nwith horror.\nI guess it takes away\nmy personal anxiety or something.\nI don\u2019t even want to know\nwhy I like them. I just like them.\nThis is The Night of the Hunter.\nCharles Laughton.\nCharles Laughton, for those\nwho don\u2019t know him,\nwas an actor, this is\nthe only film he\u2019s done.\nHe was...\n[00:03:00]\na big adult when he did it,\nI think over 50 years old.\nSo this means that\nthere is always hope in life\nto get something\nvery, very good done once.\nI think when you\u2019re a child\nand you get the luck of discovering\nvery strong movies like this,\nit\u2019s very difficult after that\nto escape from cinema and say,\n\u201cOkay, now I want to be a dentist.\u201d\nIt\u2019s probably influenced me so much.\nAnd I was a quite lonely, alone kid.\nSo I spent so much time\nwatching all these movies.\nAnd it was really\na very important thing, like,\nto be able to rely\non cinema when you\u2019re alone.\nA Special Day\nis not a feel-good movie at all.\nIt\u2019s just a wonderful film.\nIt\u2019s by Ettore Scola, Sophia Loren,\nand my father.\nAnd it\u2019s just two characters,\none set, it\u2019s...\nI wanted to say something else.\nI don\u2019t know what it was.\nbut I\u2019m going to put this in\nin the meantime.\n[00:04:01]\nOh, yes!\nYes, because I think\nwhat\u2019s interesting about...\nBecause, the other day,\nsomeone told me,\n\u201cWhat is so modern\nabout your father, in your opinion?\u201d\nAnd I think\u2013\nwhat came to my head\nis I think it\u2019s the fact\nthat you have, you know,\nItalian cinema, Italian icons,\nthe idea of the male figure\nhas always been something very\nmacho, you know, virile.\nAnd suddenly you have this actor\nwho comes in, my father,\nwith a very delicate way\nof moving himself.\nAnd actually my father always told me\nthat the first movies he\u2019s done,\nwell before he was famous,\nbecause fame came late in his life,\nhe was dubbed because they thought\nhe had such a soft voice\nthat it couldn\u2019t\nbe right for a man.\nAnd I think that\u2019s exactly\nwhat makes him so special\nis that he proposed\na different version of a man,\nthe possibility to be\nsomeone that seduces you\nwithout brutality,\n[00:05:01]\nwithout machoism.\nThere is another one\nthat I completely forgot.\nTo just give you indigestion\ntalking about\nmy father all the time.\nSo The Organizer is\na Monicelli movie that\nwent very bad when it came out.\nAbsolutely no success.\nIt\u2019s the story of\nof a factory in the beginning\nof the 1900s, and...\nthe workers are not treated\nproperly by the boss\nand this character\nthat my dad plays\nis kind of an idealist guy\nwho arrives\nin this...\nfactory.\nAnd little by little,\nhe\u2019s going to be able to help them\nbe conscious that they can\nstand up for themselves\nand that they can\nfight.\nSo you\u2019re going to say, \u201cOf course,\nyou\u2019re French, you talk about strike.\u201d\nBut in this case, I\u2019m Italian too.\nAnd it\u2019s just that it\u2019s,\nI think, you know...\nI wish we could say\nthis is all in the past but, you know,\n[00:06:00]\nwe know nowadays\nit\u2019s still complicated.\nSo I think this is a very...\nstill actual film.\nFor my last one, I\u2019m going to close my eyes\nand put my finger somewhere\nand we\u2019ll see what comes out.\nI don\u2019t know the right or the left.\nLet\u2019s see.\nThings to Come, H.G. Wells.\nOh my God, this I have not seen.\nBut the title and the author\nand what we\u2019re living right now,\nit\u2019s a sign."}

So,\njust start yakking on. Okay, here I am\nin the closet. I'm very lucky. There's a\nlot of stuff here looking around. Oh,\nwell, the first thing I see is this. Oh,\nit's only DVD, which is a shame. Um, a\nhorse's mouth. Now, I saw this on TV in\nthe UK and um it's an incredible movie\nabout an artist and I think it's John\nBradby does all the drawings and uh and\nthe artwork in it and it's Alec Guinness\nand for me this is like a kind of a um\nalmost like a sidebyside piece to\nsomething like Lady Killers which I\nwould have watched um quite a lot when I\nwas a kid but I remember taping this\nprobably off it might have been off\nmovie Drrome actually the Alex Cox show\nand um and I I loved it a lot and as\nI've walking around the criterion\noffices. I saw a poster for it and I\nthought, \"God, I love the horse's mouth.\nI I hope I run into it in the cupboard\nand I have.\" So, that's going that's\nnumber one pick. This is one of my\nfavorite films, Gray Gardens. But I have\n[00:01:00]\nit so I'm not going to take it. But, um,\nyeah, it's such a brilliant movie. And\num Lori Rose, the DP um that I've shot\nall my films with, and I will often\nwatch Gray Gardens before making a\nmovie, just to remind ourselves um how\nto move the camera as if it's an\ninquiring eye.\nTwo-lane black top, Monty Helman. Um\nthis is possibly I mean, my hand is\ngetting cold by holding this cuz this is\nprobably the coolest film that's ever\nbeen made anywhere. Now, Things to Come\nwas a film I saw when I was a kid and um\nsaw it on TV not knowing what it was and\nstarted watching it just thinking it was\na normal war movie and then it slowly\nbecame a sci-fi film and then completely\nfreaked me out and I was like um I I I\nthought that basically I'd slipped into\nan alternate reality where this might\nhave happened and I haven't seen it\nsince I was like um 12 or something. So,\nI'm looking forward to getting back to\nthat one of the most one of the original\nsci-fi movies. This is one that will\nmake my my wife Amy jump happy. Fishing\n[00:02:01]\nwith John, which is a particular\nfavorite in our house, but we've only\nseen it on um you know, to my shame on\non slightly crappy YouTube rips. So, um\nwe love this. If you haven't seen it,\nyou should see it immediately. It's one\nof the funniest things. Seven Samurai.\nIt's one of the greatest action films\never made. And it's also Criterion Disc\n2, which is going to be quite exciting\nfor my collection at home. How many\ncupboards have you got?\nI'm over here sometime. Oh, right. Okay.\nNow, speaking of samuris, I'll go for\nthe blind uh swordsman here. Now, this\nis one of two um things that uh\ncartoonist Jeff Darrow told me to pick\nup. And I was chatting to him in Chicago\nthe other day and he's going, \"Have you\nseen this?\" And I was like, \"Ah, damn\nit, Jeff. I haven't seen it.\" Oh, it's\nlike embarrassing. He said, \"You should\ndefinitely see it.\" So, now I can. Wow,\nthat's a nice one. That's big\nseconds. This is a brilliant film. And\nuh again, I remember seeing this\ncompletely blind, not knowing what it\n[00:03:01]\nwas and uh being completely spun out by\nit. And like the kind of in just in the\nfirst um 10 minutes of it u that the the\nthe plot is so twisty turny and the use\nof um wide angle lenses is especially\nbrilliant. Yeah, this is like meeting up\nwith an old friend. Hello.\nThis is one of my favorite films, Sweet\nSmell of Success. And um I love it also\nbecause it's like a this is the actual\nproper um uh sister film to um The Lady\nKillers that you know that you can go\nfrom making uh that Mckendendricks can\ngo from making Lady Killers to go to\nmaking this. So the quint quintessential\nEnglish film to the quint quintessential\nAmerican film in in one um in one leap.\nAnd also Mckendendrick's wrote one of\nthe greatest books on um film making and\nif you haven't read it you should read\nit immediately because it's the only\nbook you need basically.\nSo, a slight change of um pace, Crumb,\nwhich I remember seeing at the cinema at\n[00:04:01]\nthe time. Um I'm a huge fan of Crumb's\nwork and this documentary is fantastic\nand kind of tragic as well and sad, but\num I could listen to Crumb's voice all\nday long and listen to he's got a\nbrilliant taste in music as well. I saw\nRumble Fish when I was a kid and I only\nhad a black and white TV so the certain\nscenes of it were completely lost on me.\nAnd I remember going to school the next\nday and going, \"Yeah, Rumblefish was\nbrilliant.\" And they go, \"Yeah, that bit\nwith the goldfish, the rumblefish was\namazing.\" I'm like, \"No, I don't know.\nWas it?\" Yeah. So now finally I'll be\nable to see it with that tiny bit of uh\ncolor in it. So that's exciting. When uh\nwe got a video uh recorder in our house,\nthe first rental I made was Water Ship\nDown and Death Race 2000. Um when there\nwas no uh control over what you could\nget from video shops at that point at\nwhatever age. Um, water ship down didn't\nwork. Um, but Death Race 2000 did work.\nAnd I think that's probably um, sums up\n[00:05:00]\nmy whole career really. Thank you."}

fact finally that would be that would be\na good ending where I have prepared a little\nso here we will start with\nthat we will start with language Fritzland\nit is the cursed so for me language\nit is totally attached to the cinema\neven if it exceeds it considerably and\nI consider that M it is the first\ngreat talking film there is a\nuse of music and sound\nquite particular and as always\nwith Fritong an absolutely exceptional saturation of the image\nwell in short Fritsong\nit is a bit our our master\nto all that is it so I put that\nin my little shopping bag what\nelse would

and\ntwo the adventure then but yes of course\nan com it is modernity in its\npure state in a certain way he invents\nmodernity for the cinema of the 60s\nas probably Godard will do on his\nside and

moment about because\nnot about Carver sorry about Alttman Robert\nAlttman so there he adapted\nCarver's short stories in a very\nvery very skillful very skillful way he it's\nreally the freedom of the story what it's the it's\nalmost it's almost\nconstructed like the surrealist corpse exquisite\nit's very deep there's the\ndepth of Carver and the lightness of\nCarver too in it it's very very beautiful\nso that that's that it's my friend\nFederic the strrada it's as if it\ncame from the cinema me precisely it's a\ncompletely expressionist film\nthe vit\u00e9oni it's it tells the\nstory of young Christians young\nbourgeois Christians in the\nItalian province and it's I think it's\nquite autobiographical it's very very\nbeautiful he concocts a story  of\nabsolute failure which ends in I think it\nends in a public dump\nsomething like that well I could how I\nsaid that for example proposed a\nthing which was the saturation of the image\nsaturation it is framed nothing can\n[00:03:02]\nenter the frame it is the frame\ncloses on the characters quickly how\nFinist it is the opposite there is a\ndepth in front of the characters it is\nthe depth of life itself and it is it is it is\noverwhelming come on that's all still I\ncan take a tour still no absolutely so\nmaxofuls of course maxoful\ndirector absolutely incredible he\nmade the round he made lo the montesse\nuh it is a kind of genius of the\nsoftness of the movement it is a Viennese spirit\nuh a Viennese spirit the other\nViennese they are we have seen them a lot in\nHollywood but let's say that this one it\nwas still exceptional and and the\nround it is a it is a sketch film\npay attention for example to the first\nsketch which is absolutely remarkable\nso I really like Claude that's it it's\na  and class tourisque which is a\nremarkable film so in\nClaude's career it was a big flop it\nwas a notorious failure and he got back on track\nhe got back on track for 4 5 6 to his\n[00:04:00]\noriginal profession which was screenwriter and\nhe had an expression he was\nnot a complete screenwriter he went over\nthe others and he said that he he was doing\nre-soming like a like a\nshoemaker there and class touris which is\na very very very beautiful film and then then\nwe get into the hard part we\ngo back to the period that I\nreally like the one that is on the border\nduum it is vampires it is dray\u00e8 and it is\nexceptional sanettron Bergman all\nthe Nordic cinema Bergman especially and the\nBergman of wild strawberries for\nexample and things like that I\nshare the taste for vampire

as soon as I\nhave a scene in one of my films I I\nalways are uh checking out if if if\nthere's a reference on YouTube and in\nfor example in in force mayor there's a\nscene where where the main character\ntumas totally breaks down and cries and\nthen I went to YouTube and and Googled\nworst man cry ever and I found a\nbeautiful uh situation in the TV show\nwhere there's like this man that have\nhold his sorrow back for so many years\nand suddenly the sorrow comes bursting\nout of his body and he can't control it\nand so I I can do some recommend\nrecommendation for for for YouTube clips\nalso so uh worst man cry ever uh idiot\nSpanish bus driver almost killed\nstudents uh battle at\nKrueger uh and finally taxi driver rink\n[00:01:00]\nyou it's this is actually not the most\nhow do you say comfortable place for me\nuh since I'm actually not from the the\nkind of background of film history uh I\nstarted making ski films but I can find\na lot of rer f binder movies uh that I\nthat I really really like I really like\nPetra Fan's the bidder tears of Petra\nFant I think I will pick that one\nViana of buuel and the the discreet\ncharm of the baz of bonuel which I think\nwould be the perfect title for for my\nnew feature film Force Major it should\nhave actually had a name of the\ndiscreete charm of the burat I mean I\nhave seen so many films I I I actually\nlike this one a lot um Katherine Brea uh\nbut I don't like this title that much\nfat girl I actually like Amur uh to my\nsister that is the French title and I I\n[00:02:01]\nthink that she had an approach\nto sexual content that was totally new\nfor me when I watched short films uh but\nthis one I actually have an this Edition\nalso so I won't take this\none um but I saw over here it was love\nstreams and this one I will take for my\nproducer Eric hundorf he he said ah you\nhave to take love streams uh I haven't\nseen it but I love a lot of young K\nfilms um and the approach of his film\nmaking and of course Gina Roland the way\nshe acts is is just fantastic so this\nwill definitely be one for the bag and I\nalso saw bicycle thieves by uh V vctor\nDEA and this film was some a film that\nRoy Anderson was talking a lot about\nwhen when when I was in film school and\nthat has been a really really important\nfilm to him and it was nice to see that\nyou have the right title on the film\n[00:03:00]\nhere uh it's for many years it was\ncalled ble\nThief uh and and I think bike cicle\nthieves is a much better uh title for\nthe film so that's that's the film that\nI definitely will take I will give this\nto Roy\nAnderson no but I can talk about in MC\nbbang actually I can talk about him\nbecause I think that what he did when it\ncomes to the Swedish Film\nCommunity um was that everybody talks\nabout him like the demon director is\nsomeone that is so in control and knows\neverything about about the films that he\nis making and and maybe when you went to\nfilm school as a film student you were a\nlittle bit afraid of exposing that you\nsometimes are not 100% sure what you are\ndoing uh and when I shot a a short film\nthat is called autobiographical scene\nnumber\n6,882 um uh I'm made an experience that\n[00:04:00]\nhad been extremely important for me as a\nas a director we were shooting this film\non a bridge a high bridge and uh there\nwas only three shots um and we had one\ncamera position each day during this\nthis shooting of the short film and on\nthe second day of shooting uh I had the\nbig plans for for the camera position I\nhave built up a or me and the crew have\nbuilt up a big tower a large Tower High\ntower on the on the bridge and on the\ntop of the tower there was like a a jib\narm in the air above the water we have\nplaced the camera and it took like half\nday of building this this construction\nto to have the the camera in that\nposition and immediately when I put in\nthe BNC cable into the Monitor and I\ncould see the image I realized I will\nnever use this\nshot and I ended up with a a\n[00:05:02]\nstruggle um because should I now tell\nthe film crew that I have made a wrong\ndecision or should I just like\ncontinuing and and and uh uh pretend\nlike this is exactly how I want to do it\nbecause you I could feel that the\nhistory of inma Burman that you should\nbe a demon director you should know\neverything you are doing was um relying\non my shoulders or on my shoulders and\nwe went to go and eat lunch and during\nthat lunch I had this inner conflict\nyeah maybe I should tell the tell the\ncrew everything is right and we just\ncontinuing the shooting and then I call\nhim back three weeks later and say we\nhave to re shoot it uh but after lunch I\nactually gather all the people in the\ncrew and I said okay I'm sorry I made a\nmistake I made a wrong wrong decision we\nhave to take down the tower uh and I\nhave to find the the camera position\nmyself so everybody was like it at that\nmoment I thought that okay there will be\n[00:06:01]\na muy people will not trust me anymore\nbut instead there was an very\nexperienced uh sound designer that came\nup to me and he said okay now I really\nreally trust you uh because I think\nthat's what fil making about when you\nare a director and you are on set you\nyou have a lot of pressure on yourself\nand if you are leaving your own\ninstrument if you're looking at\nsomething in the image and it's\nsomething that it's not exactly how you\nwant it then you have to be very very\nsensitive to your instrument and you\nhave to follow that instrument and as\nsoon as you are leaving your own\ninstrument and you are just doing things\nto to avoid um uh struggle during the\nshooting then you're also leaving the\nthe reason why you are a\ndirector"}

and\ndirector and I'm\nvery I'm very happy to be here I love\nthe Criterion Collection it's meant a\nlot to me and I'd say like while we were\nworking together like I feel like we\nwere constantly referencing all the\nmovies in this closet I'm Lucian\nJohnston uh I'm a film editor I helped\nAnnie edit her film Janet planet and uh\nyeah feel very lucky to be here we're\ngoing to start with long F new by the\ndirector and writer Maurice P one of my\nfavorite favorite writer directors so\nthis is from 1968 it's about\num kind of a foster child being shuttled\naround France and moving from family to\nfamily it's like one of the most\nunsentimental movies about childhood\nI've ever seen I felt like it was the\nfirst movie I'd seen with like a child\nlead who you didn't necessarily\nsympathize with for most of the movie\n[00:01:01]\nand then once you understand him by the\nend of it it's like totally devastating\nI feel like very at the mercy of paa as\na filmmaker when I'm watching his films\nlike kind of like anything could happen\nI feel like the films are kind of out of\ncontrol in a way that is like really\nlike almost disturbing in a way that I\nthink for some people that could be\ninterpreted as like a cold approach or\nsomething but there's no like\ncalculation there okay lar other than\npaa the other filmmaker we talked about\na lot when we were cutting Janet planet\nwas uh prison I feel like prison was\nmore of like an\naesthetic like reference for us too I I\nremember specifically about laran we\nwere talking\nabout depictions of offscreen violence\nyes that's what I was just thinking I\nalways think of the end when um at the\n[00:02:01]\nfarm the old couple the when the husband\nslaps his wife it's instead of seeing\nthe slap he cuts away and you just see\nthe the teacup on the on the little\nsaucer and it just kind of moves a\nlittle bit I like he has a thing about\nsuppressing intention and this idea of\nlike actually what you need to do is\nlike suppress people's intentions and so\naccidents can happen oh yeah matter of\nlife and death okay initially in Janet\nplanet we were going to have a character\ndisappear on screen I don't feel like\nthat's giving away too much and we were\nobsessed with how to do it and we ended\nup just not doing it but I kept watching\nthe disappearances in this movie on the\nCriterion Channel and sending them to\nyou and you would like calculate how\nmany frames The Disappearance was and\nit's like three for me there's just\nsomething about the way that Powell and\npressburger films look that is that's\nwhy I love them so much I mean their\ncinematographer Jack Cardiff was\nincredible but there's just nothing that\n[00:03:01]\nlooks like a pal and fresberg film\nthere's some scene near the beginning\nwhere like the fog lifts and it's so\ntrippy do you know what I'm talking\nabout like at the beach and I remember\nreading I got really into reading\nMichael Powell's Memoir and it just was\nJack C of like breathing on the lens\nyeah we'll not we're we I'll do godland\nthis movie was one of my very very top\nfavorites of 2023 and maybe ever the DP\nis our amazing DP Maria vanon house wolf\nand so much of watching this movie for\nme was like seeing Maria the way Maria\nsees nature and the world through the\nway she shot this movie and it makes me\nso so happy I think in particular of\nlike a a a\nshot um sort of like descending shot of\na waterfall at one point one of those\nlike incredibly humongous Icelandic\nwaterfalls and there's this moment where\nthe camera sort of almost like pauses\nand waivers in the middle because the\ncamera kind of stops and then keeps\ngoing it almost feels like an accident\n[00:04:02]\nor something and I've seen you get those\ntypes of like happy accidents in\nperformance a lot like I see that a lot\nwhen I'm cutting performances where an\nactor Will kind of mess something up or\nsay the wrong line but it's it's really\ngood and and almost better than what it\nwas supposed to be so you just kind of\nroll with it but I've never seen that\nwith like a camera before and but that\nsequence I think that's what's so kind\nof magical about it is in any other film\nyou would bump on that and instead of\nbumping it kind of just like elevates\nthe sequence even more nature it feels\nimperfection of it is yeah and the\nunexpected I I don't know I feel like so\nthat was a really difficult shoot\napparently they actually like made the\njourney themselves across Iceland that\nthe characters making in the movie they\nshot with all natural light except for\nlike two scenes that were just candle\nlight I mean it's it's like literally\nabout nature you're overtaking man and\n[00:05:00]\nthen I feel like actually you feel that\nit's happening with the film making too\ndesigned for\nliving um I'm obsessed with this movie I\nhave a poster of this movie in my study\nwell this is like from 1933 this is like\nimmediately precode it wouldn't even be\nmade now because it's like so ambiguous\nambiguous but also like incredibly\nblatant like I think what's so she's in\nlove with two men they're kind of in\nlove with her I mean they're in totally\nin love with her she's in love with them\nthe end of the movie she's like making\nout with both of them in the back of a\ncar so this was based on a Noel coward\nplay but apparently the first scene of\nthis movie which is one of my favorite\nscenes was not in the Noel coward play\nwhere she's like in the train car and\nthey're sleeping and they haven't seen\nher yet and she's drawing them right and\nFrederick March and Gary Cooper are so\nincredible and beautiful and like\nhilarious and vulnerable and doofy and\nMiriam Hopkins is like such a specific\nperson and she's also into her work and\nthere's something about the movie that I\nfind so life affirming about like work\n[00:06:01]\nand desire um oh yeah well I do it's\nalways I feel like we're just talking\nabout it's like talking about vaa and\nBone and P W this is so good there's so\nmuch good stuff you have this I don't\nthink I do you should take it you should\ntake it I'm going to totally butcher\nthis this but um narot is my f favorite\nof all the films in this collection I\nthink the reason I like it so much is\nbecause I find it very difficult to talk\nabout film editing um even as an editor\nit just of all the film crafts it's kind\nof the impossible one to actually talk\nabout well I think it a lot of people\nlike to talk about Pace or things like\nthat but that's just one really really\nlittle thing it's it's very difficult to\nactually talk about film editing but in\nthis film there's a sequence in one of\nthe local cafes where a magician is is\nputting on his act and during that\nsequence she's showing you how she's\nkind of making the associ a while she's\n[00:07:00]\nmaking them she's kind of showing you\nthe manipulation of the work and it's\nvery self-conscious but it's not\nacademic there's nothing like dactic\nabout the way she's showing it to you\nit's very very playful and there's it\nit's just kind of it feels almost like a\nprecursor to some something like what um\nto like maybe what like John Wilson is\ndoing now it's some of the best editing\nI've ever seen and you can see it\nbecause most of the time you can't

moment you know to be a part of\nCinema history so here we go folks and\nI'm I'm going deep all right this goes\nback way back to way my way back machine\nrenette Claire's I married a witch now I\nhave married a witch my Wonder witch\nwhich you know my wife Karina is my\npartner in my jingle toown films company\nand we just rock and roll together but\nshe definitely has that\nmagical uh I'm already rich out uh uh in\nthis film is Veronica Lake who I just\nadore and this film was a pre uh like\nlike uh um be witched was made after\nthis now if you haven't seen anything\n[00:01:01]\nwith old special effects and you know\nyou know just a 1940s feel of sauciness\nand witchery and comedy this is great\nthis is great stuff\nhere all right okay so I go back way\nback to where I started at ruers in New\nBrunswick um I studied uh video art and\nwe studied experimental makers rber\nHammer you know a few others buers in\nthis collection but I'm not going to go\nthere right now but another person whose\nwork that I really loved was Hollis\nFrampton and they have his collection\nhere of his shorter works from 66 to 79\nhe did films he did he played with time\nand speed and and just questioned Cinema\nand the tality of it and what it means\nwith representation this is really\nsomething if you want to like learn\nabout form which is very important to\nlearn about how to um learn about\nnarrative so there's moments between\npeople talking and what you see and\n[00:02:00]\nFrampton gives you a lot to see here so\nthis is something I'm I'm going to take\nas well there's mudbound here my gosh\nshout out to the other queers uh the\ncameraman look at this oh my gosh early\nCinema huh Buster K and comedy you know\nwhat I'm just going to add to the bag\nanyway huh I have the opportunity to do\nthat look I'm just saying Shantel acran\nBuu Shantel arrian we know what it means\nI know what it means Jean de which you\nknow is just the tip of the iceberg of\nwhat acrian has\ndone I mean I don't want to go through\nit all but you should and um I'm taking\nit with\nme yeah one of the more recent ads to\ntheir collection is to die for all right\nI\nmean Gusman sand\nI I'm going to my heart here I'm going\nto see if I can\nfind uhoh\n[00:03:01]\nnow as a black queer\nfilmmaker I must say we have few mentors\nfew people's work that we can look up to\num to find ourselves in to um even speak\nto to figure out who we are as\nfilmmakers and I was fortunate enough to\nmeet and speak with and be encouraged by\nMarlon Rigs and they have the Marlon\nrigs collection here when he passed he\nleft a lot behind and he left most\nimportantly um his work behind for us\nand this is a collection of his work and\nit's always so hard to find it really is\nalways so hard to find streaming or\nanywhere and it's here in the collection\nso um I'm going to take that and I would\nsay you should take that um and and find\nit here and and add it to your\ncollection because there's very few um\nagain black queer makers uh work um as\nso important as\n[00:04:00]\nMar how to take a breather on that one\noh my box sets don't forget my box sets\nmy box set of the BRD fast vendor who I\nmean he was a\npost-war um German young filmmaker with\nradical ideas and\nreally\nre inscribed invented and fused a new\nsort of Life forced into melodrama\nfamily dramas postwar dramas living how\ndo we live talking about the kind of\ncore of of of of life and its values but\num this has Lola the ver the marriage of\nMaria Brown uh Veronica Voss in it um so\nthis is a real great special collection\nof of that work and it's a great\nintroduction to um German Cinema from\nthis time period um that's in my special\ncollection I asked for I told you I was\ngoing deep and hard and Barda is the\n[00:05:00]\none I'm here for all my homages I'm here\nfor people whose Cinema I just can't\nlive without\nto help me make Cinema and continue to\nmake Cinema and go back to again

right\nthere I I just going to shout out to\nfind myself in the collection\nso look order my own woman and I I guess\nI'm really into the collection as well\nuh here at Criterion because I love\nCinema and um I've always loved Cinema\num it's the Seventh Art um and it\nreally allows me to express myself\nallows me to be a story teller allows me\nto invent to reinvent which Cinema is\nabout reinvention take things off the\n[00:06:00]\nwall and put into the world um but I'll\nput it back here so others can take it\nyou know what I'm saying I don't know if\nI want to keep you

thrilled to be\nhere and to choose among this amazing\ncollection I'm going to start with the\nfilm that actually I shot and the reason\nis that we recently did this remastering\nof the the movie so it's a new color\ngrading the original video color timing\nwas done without our supervision\nAlejandro Alejandro Gonzalez and myself\nAmores Perros we use the film print uh\nto to uh to make this version of it so\nit's it's much closer to the way people\nexperienced it on a cinema so uh I'm\nexcited about that and I'm taking it\nhome to to have this version I'll take\nwomen on the verge of our nervous\nbreakdown I remember being so struck by\nthe the color and the cinematography of\nit it reminded me of uh the lighting\nthat I was seeing in still photography\nsoft\nside light that sort of thing very\nneutral in color the light but not the\n[00:01:01]\nsets obviously very colorful so years\nyears later I got the chance to work\nwith\nin a movie called broken Embraces in\nwhich we actually uh emulated this film\nin one of the sequences and I used a\nspecific uh film Emulsion that was a\nectochrome\nbecause the colors were especially\nsaturated on that film stock it was\nreversal actually and I wanted that part\nof the movie to be even more color\nsaturated than the rest of it which is\nalready pretty saturated so in honor of\nthat moment I'll take one of the verge\nof a nervous breakdown quite done\nthis movie I pick because uh I'm about\nto embark on a new chapter of my career\nI'm going to direct the movie\nuh if everything goes well knock on wood\nit's an adaptation of Pedro Panama which\nis this uh very famous uh Mexican novel\nand with this this movie pero paramo\nincludes uh dead people ghosts if you\n[00:02:03]\nmay\nthat's part of the film so so my\ndaughter Maria who I went to film School\nrecommended this film uh because it's a\nanthology of I think it's four or five\nuh\nghost stories it's very\num tactile it's it's uh you can you can\nfeel this set is you see the\nartificiality of it and I think this\nmovie for me is a reminder that anything\ngoes in cinema\nRaging Bull my favorite film\nalso just um stylistically it's uh it's\nsome amazing for me it was a huge\ndiscovery of sound for example the sound\ndesign this movie is is uh really\nincredible because you feel the world\naround them the tenements where Scorsese\ngrew up you really get a feel for being\nin one of these small apartments and\nhearing the neighborhood around I've\nbeen working with Mr Martin Scorsese for\nfor a while I've been doing a few movies\nit all started with uh\n[00:03:00]\nwith the Wolf of Wall Street and later I\nlearned a weird thing that uh uh\nScorsese wanted to meet me because the\nmovie I did with Angeli called lust\ncaution and uh which has nothing to do\nwith Wolf of Wall Street it couldn't be\nmore opposite in style and uh and that's\none thing that I've enjoyed throughout\nmy careers is really going in different\ndirections stylistically as a\ncinematographer yes Rumble Fish okay an\noldie but goodie for me and the sound\nagain the sound was amazing the main\ncharacter a motorcycle boy he if I\nremember correctly couldn't hear well so\nthe sound is very much like it would be\nthe sound is somehow muffled or you\ndon't hear lots of the Ambient sound you\njust hear kind of the dialogue and that\nit's artificial but it's subjective and\nI found that really interesting it's\ntrue I have mentioned sound in a couple\nof the movies that I've talked about\neven though my thing is imagery I'm a\ncinematographer but uh I I think of\n[00:04:02]\nimages in terms of how they might sound\nbecause after all an image is vibration\nlight is vibration obviously and it's uh\nuh sound there's vibration too and when\nI'm designing shots or even lighting or\ncamera movement I often make a noise\nwhen I'm describing it and people make\nfun of me a little bit but it doesn't\nwhat it is so I might say okay we'll\npush in and it'll sound like\nor but if I want faster it's more like\n[Music]\nthat connection between image and sound\nis essential in cinema yes afterlife\nthis film is so beautiful and the whole\npremise is that people die go to this\nbuilding and they're interviewed by by\nuh these people who are actually working\nthe place and uh they have to say a\nmoment in their lives that they'd like\nto uh they'd be willing to live to\nEternity a moment these people just\n[00:05:01]\nsaying these very simple moments that\nthey remember as the most cherished\nmoment of their lives is truly wonderful\nthe meaning of life literally and it\nmade me think of okay so what is my\nfavorite moment in my life and\num\nand yes I I picked uh and I still think\nit was uh one day in my honeymoon with\nmy wife it was just\nwonderful to to remember that and then I\ngo back to that day often and that's\nbecause in my memory because of this\nfilm so life-changing movie I highly\nrecommend thank you so much for this\nhopefully some of these uh might be\nreminders to whoever sees this of some\ninteresting films that I find very\ninspiring hopefully it can Inspire\nothers as well"}

kyle\nwe're going to do this and we're going\nto audition at my house we're going to\nmake it happen\nmy john frankenheimer and my john\nhouston are very very similar so don't\npay attention to that anyway directed by\njohn frankenheimer\nloved john tough on his crew\nbut um loved his actors loved his actors\nbeing there oh my god this is great\npeter sellers\npeter sellers performance was\nagain i borrowed\nyou know just or was inspired by let's\nsay his character for again for um the\ndougie character in in twin peaks of\nreturn i just the the the\num\n[00:03:00]\nthe child like\nquality\nthat he had in his eyes and just the\nwonder\nand\nthe way he looked at the world it was\nvery helpful to me and this one is great\ni just caught my aroma\nwow that's heavy\nalfonso\num\nsuch a beautiful movie\nsuch a delicate movie so i worked with\nalfonso on uh\na series called believe\na number of years ago\nand\nit was such a pleasure i i had been\nworking i kind of had a lull in my\ncareer i guess and uh have been working\nand\nuh but i hadn't really worked with\nanyone\nof this caliber of alfonso's\ncaliber and i just had a couple days on\non the series but something washed over\nme like a kiss a remembrance i'd\ni said oh this reminds me of lynch this\nreminds me of frankenheimer this reminds\nme of the great directors that i work\nwith and i kind of lost that\n[00:04:02]\nfeeling somehow\nand he gave it back to me and i'll ever\nbe forever grateful for that\nhere's david's\ndavid lynch we can't go\nany more time without talking about\ndavid so david and i uh you know we have\na long collaboration together\num starting with dune in 83 and then\nblue velvet and then twin peaks\nand\nhe is a good friend and\ni cherish that relationship\nand then count myself incredibly lucky\nto have worked with him so frequently\nand collaborated with him\nwe have such a good time it's it's not\nwork at all it's just\nplay time the elephant man is beautiful\nbeautiful film and i know that he felt a\ngreat affinity with\nthat character and john hurt did an\nextraordinary job anthony hopkins\ni work with anthony later on we did a\nmovie called uh the trial together and\nwe spent three nights in kutnahora in\n[00:05:01]\nczechoslovakia at that time\nczechoslovakia czech republic\nuh filming in this cold cold church\nand we basically do impersonations of\nactors so\ni would do my best and then he would do\noh my god clark gable was was he was\namazing car cable and then he and then\nwe would do david lynch together so we'd\nbe doing dueling david's because he\nworked on this one of course i knew\ndavid very well so it's kind of like\nthis we were talking like this and to\nhear anthony hopkins do it david lynch\nwell you haven't lived until you've\nheard that now this one\nblue velvet was\nkind of the\nkind of a rebirth for me\nbecause we done doom together in 83 and\ndune didn't really turn out that well in\nfact\num\ni was kind of after that it was sort of\ni felt like i was a pariah in the\nbusiness\nno work no nothing but david bless his\nheart\nhe'd given me the script to blue velvet\nwhen we were filming while we were\nfilming dune in mexico city and i read\nit and i was like whoa\nthis is this is very very intense and i\n[00:06:00]\nreally liked it and i really identified\nwith the character of jeffrey but david\nand i were planning to go shoot blue\nvelvet right after dune was released in\nwinter of 84. and because dune didn't do\nso well they postponed it and so things\nhappened and then finally blue velvet\ncame to pass in uh in the summer of that\nyear in the summer of 85 we shot this\nin wilmington north carolina\nand we had\nsuch a lovely time i mean it was dennis\nhopper isabella russellini laura during\nmyself dean stockwell brad dorff as\ntraumatic as dune was for him i know it\nwas blue velvet was a whole different\nreality and\nwe were in our element\nand and it was uh\nand he came back to me that's the point\ni guess is you know he did we did doom\ntogether and he could easily have said\nwell that you know kyle he didn't really\nhelp the movie and so i'm gonna find\nsomebody else and uh he didn't do that\nhe he wanted me\nand i'll be forever grateful thanks\n[00:07:02]\ndavid i actually have blue velvet so i'm\ngonna put this one back for someone else\nto find an experience and\nenjoy\ni think i'm done thanks for having me\ngot my bag\nready to go\nyou"}

Okay, cool.\nI\u2019m going to start\nwith Exterminating Angel.\nI guess this is\none of those films that\nis both, like, I can\u2019t touch it,\nbut I\u2019m inspired by it.\nI\u2019m not trying to ever make\na film that\u2019s this perfect,\nbecause it says everything\nso simply and so clearly.\nAnd perfectly.\nBut a lot of my movies go into a place\nwhich can\u2019t really happen,\nbut hopefully speaks\nto something that\u2019s very\u2026\neven more truthful about the situation,\nand that\u2019s Exterminating Angel for me,\nwhich is, like, people\u2019s barriers\nwithin each other and between each other\nin the most poetic but also\npoignant and straightforward way.\nSo I was going to choose\nNight of the Hunter,\nbecause what\u2019s amazing\nabout the Criterion is that it has\nall these extras,\nincluding an hour of dailies\nwhere you get to hear\nCharles Laughton direct.\nSometimes I can visit set and see\ndirectors I appreciate doing their work,\n[00:01:02]\nbut to hear a master like\nCharles Laughton directly,\nhis conversation\nwith the actor, with the DP.\nIt is the film school\u2013\nThat is an essential part of, I think,\never becoming a director.\nI would make that the lesson one\nand the final lesson\nof any school I ever had.\nBut since I feel like\nI have a bunch of copies\nof Night of the Hunter \u2013\na lot of my DVDs do disappear\nbecause of people borrowing\nand not putting them back.\nbut I\u2019m pretty sure\nNight of the Hunter is still on my shelf.\nBut Hobson\u2019s Choice,\nstarring Charles Laughton.\nAnything that Charles Laughton\ndid, for the most part,\nI think is out of this world,\nand that\u2019s why I\u2019m getting this.\nAn inspiration.\nLa Vie de Boh\u00e8me.\nI love all Kaurism\u00e4ki\u2019s films.\nFor me, for whatever reason,\nthis is like everything comes together.\nIt\u2019s kind of miraculous.\nIt has this fantasy.\nIt\u2019s completely grounded.\nIt\u2019s hilarious. It\u2019s also very moving.\nAnd what he does\nwith this train pulling out, using\u2026\n[00:02:00]\nI won\u2019t go into it, but he does it\nin the most magnificent way\nthat makes me think\nevery time, \u201cI can\u2019t afford that.\u201d\nThen you think, \u201cOh, Aki figured out\nhow to do it for basically 50 cents.\u201d\nLucrecia Martel, La Ci\u00e9naga.\nI watch her work and I go,\n\u201cI cannot ever\neven try to do something like that\nbecause it\u2019s\u2026\neverything is flawless and perfect.\u201d\nBut I\u2019m going to keep watching\nbecause it\u2019s just the best of the best.\nGirlfriends.\nI think about\u2013\nLike, another miracle of a film.\nAny time that I\u2019m thinking,\n\u201cHow do I do this?\nI need this and I need that.\u201d\nThen you see this movie and go,\n\u201cOh, I can just use what I have\nand make something.\u201d\nIf anything, it\u2019ll be a home movie\nthat I want to hold onto.\nOr it could turn out\nas amazing as this film.\nI saw this, T\u00f3tem.\nI thought this was brilliant.\nWritten beautifully, directed,\nacting, shot so beautifully.\nJust a film that I love. I think\nI\u2019m ready to dive in and see it again.\n[00:03:01]\nMiracle in Milan,\nthis is one of those movies that\u2013\nMy parents would always drive\nmyself and my sister to films\nthat they thought were\nfilms that they loved\nand also that could work for kids.\nThere\u2019s a moment at the end of this\nthat I completely took as\nrealistic at the time, but it kind of\u2026\ndefies gravity,\nand it blew my mind as a kid.\nAnd it was something\nI always held on to\nis thinking,\n\u201cFilms, if they feel real,\nwill take you someplace\ncompletely unexpected.\u201d\nAnd I love it.\nThe Breakfast Club.\nI don\u2019t know why it spoke so deeply\nto me growing up in New York City,\nmy school was nothing like this,\nbut, for whatever reason,\nstayed with me,\nwatched it a bunch of times.\nNow that I\u2019ve been making movies,\nI realize that\nnot only did it influence my storytelling,\nbut just to see, like,\n\u201cWow, there\u2019s a lot of bold choices.\u201d\nThen once you find out\nDede Allen is the editor on it,\n[00:04:01]\nyou realize, \u201cOh, it\u2019s\u2026\nvery, very purposeful\nand working in this whole other level.\u201d\nPandora\u2019s Box.\nLouise Brooks starring in it.\nI think she\u2019s one of\nthe best writers on film.\nLulu in Hollywood,\nI would highly recommend that book\nbecause she can write about film\nlike nobody else.\nThis is a movie my father, Ken Jacobs,\ntalks about all the time.\nAnd I have to be honest,\nI don\u2019t believe I ever saw it.\nSo I know this is probably the best way\nthat I could ever possibly see it.\nAnd then I could no longer\npretend that I\u2019ve seen it with him.\nAnd I\u2019m sure I\u2019m going to find it\nas brilliant as he did.\nThanks so much."}
