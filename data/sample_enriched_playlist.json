I really love it."},{"title":"Straw Dogs","description":"A perfect film, one of the great films about, you know, just how awful it is to be a person living with other people. And it\u2019s also one of the tightest films ever made. It begins in a fraught place and just\u2026 it\u2019s a snare that just tightens and tightens and tightens until the climax, which is just one of the greatest in all of movies."},{"title":"Ace in the Hole","description":"The first truly reviled movie that he ever released. And it\u2019s a really misanthropic comedy that is genuinely upsetting, genuinely funny. Honest in its anger in a way that a lot of films made in America in the \u201950s weren\u2019t allowed to be.

Really specifically observed and very funny. And it\u2019s a film that I come back to a lot. I find it very comforting. It also has such a\u2026 like, a wonderful texture. Bogdanovich made some great films, but this to me is the greatest."},{"title":"Targets","description":"Once you\u2019ve seen Eddington, you will understand where these are connected. Maybe the best film made under Roger Corman. Bogdanovich also acts in the movie, and it\u2019s not his best performance. That would be The Sopranos."},{"title":"Young Mr. Lincoln","description":"Two of my favorite John Ford films, two of his most romantic films, films about the heroic myth of America, the dream of America.

So,\nBob Fosse, All That Jazz.\nSo I just watched this again\nquite recently, actually.\nIt\u2019s a work of\nabsolute genius, in my opinion.\nAnd if you want to look at where a lot\nof modern editing gets its ideas from,\njust look at the sequences of him\ntaking the pills,\nwhich are spread throughout it.\nI think that\u2019s a great movie.\nGreat, great, great,\ngreat, great, great movie.\nSo this is one I am taking home.\nSo they\u2019ve got Anora,\nwhich\u2026\nTo my shame,\nI hadn\u2019t seen his other movies.\nAnd I went immediately\nafter watching Anora,\nwhich I thought was just wonderful,\nand I went back to Florida Project,\nwhich is even more remarkable in a way.\nAnd I\u2019d missed it the first time around.\nSo apologies, Sean Baker, and chapeau.\n[00:01:00]\nThey\u2019ve got one of his other films here,\nwhich I am going to take,\nThe Prince of Broadway,\nwhich I knew about, but I haven\u2019t seen.\nSo I\u2019ll be taking both those,\nplease, if I may.\nSo I have to give a shout-out to\na great and very, very underrated\nBritish director,\nStephen Frears.\nReally one of our great craftsmen.\nAnd this is a film he made\nwith John Cusack, Anjelica Huston,\nand Annette Bening:\nThe Grifters.\nI think it\u2019s based on a Jim Thompson\nnovel or short story, and\u2026\nwho\u2019s a great writer.\nIncredible.\nThis, you\u2019ve got to see this film\nfor three sterling performances.\nYou watch Annette Bening and you think,\n\u201cOh my goodness me, what an actor.\u201d\nYeah, I was looking\u2026\nI was looking for Fish Tank.\nAnd there it is.\nYes. Oh, here we go.\nSo this is a British filmmaker,\nAndrea Arnold.\nIf you don\u2019t know her,\nyou should see her work.\nTrue independent. Brilliant filmmaker.\nThis is a wonderful film that she made.\n[00:02:01]\nMichael Fassbender\u2019s in it,\nand it\u2019s partly about Essex,\nwhich is an area of the UK.\nAnd it has the most extraordinary\nskies. You cannot believe the\u2026\nThey\u2019re so beautiful\nand it\u2019s shot by Robbie Ryan,\nwho I think shot\nher new movie, Bird, as well.\nThe casting that she does,\nthe way she finds actors\u2026\nremarkable.\nYeah, wonderful film\nand a wonderful filmmaker.\nSo there is a theory that\u2026\nwhich I\u2019m happy to say\nthat this is absolute proof of,\nthat your first film\nis always your best film.\nAnd my first film, which is also available\non the Criterion Collection,\nwas called Shallow Grave, and it\u2026\nMy dad always used to say\u2026\nI used to take my dad to all my films,\nand he\u2019d say the same thing every time\nwhen he came out of them.\nDidn\u2019t matter what it was,\nwhether it\u2019d won Oscars or whatever,\nhe said, \u201cOh yeah, it was good, son,\nbut it wasn\u2019t as good as Shallow Grave.\u201d\nSo he believed the theory that\nyour first film is always your best film.\n[00:03:00]\nTo say that the Coen brothers have\nnever made a better movie than this\nis not an insult. It is an extraordinary\u2026\nIt just shows you the talent that\u2019s there,\nand you can see them\nlearning their craft as they make it.\nSo if you want to watch\nwhere it all began,\nthen this is the one to start with:\nBlood Simple.\nOh my goodness me.\nSo,\nI was talking earlier about\nShallow Grave, the first film, and\none of the buzzes when you do films\nand you kind of like\u2026\nyou get invited to exotic places.\nAnd we got invited to\nCuba,\nto the Havana Film Festival.\nAnd it was an incredible experience\nto be in Cuba.\nAnd two of the films that we saw\nwhile we were there\nwas this:\nI Am Cuba, which is a staple\nand is recommended,\nand everybody should see it really.\nBut\nthis film\nis\nthe film with the worst title, I think,\nprobably imaginable.\n[00:04:00]\nIt\u2019s called Memories of Underdevelopment,\nand it\u2019s a film by Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea.\nWhat can I tell you about this film?\nWhen I saw this film,\nwe were working on Trainspotting,\nso we\u2019d released Shallow Grave\nand we were working on Trainspotting,\nand I can\u2019t remember whether we\u2019d\u2026\nI think we\u2019d shot\u2026\nNo, we hadn\u2019t shot it.\nWe were working on it,\nand we didn\u2019t have an ending.\nAnd I saw this film,\nand I stole,\nframe by frame,\nthe last shot of this film\nfor the last shot of Trainspotting.\nAnd if you happen to watch this movie,\nwhich is available on Criterion\nand is available on an extraordinary,\nproper regrade of this,\nyou\u2019ll see the last shot of this film\nas it was intended to do,\nas it reflected\nthe last shot of this film.\nAnd you\u2019ll realize how\nthe phrase,\n\u201cWe stand on the shoulder of giants,\u201d\nis\nhighly appropriate. Yeah.\nThank you for listening, or watching.","guest":"Danny Boyle","year":"2024","movies":[{"title":"All That Jazz","description":"A work of absolute genius with influential editing techniques, especially in the sequences of the main character taking pills."},{"title":"Anora","description":"A wonderful film by Sean Baker."},{"title":"The Prince of Broadway","description":"A film by Sean Baker that the guest has not seen yet but is taking home."},{"title":"The Grifters","description":"A film by Stephen Frears based on a Jim Thompson novel, featuring sterling performances from John Cusack, Anjelica Huston, and Annette Bening."},{"title":"Fish Tank","description":"A film by British filmmaker Andrea Arnold, starring Michael Fassbender.
